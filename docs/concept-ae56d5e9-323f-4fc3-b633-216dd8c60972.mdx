# What is TestOps Private Instance?

TestOps Private Instance is a single-tenant cloud architecture where a single software instance and its supporting infrastructure/database serve only one customer, a.k.a tenant.

Users can have an isolated TestOps instance with separate application nodes, isolated networking, and database resources. This creates a more secure environment than a multi-tenant architecture where a single software instance and database serve multiple customers.

To learn more about single-tenant and multi-tenant architectures, you can refer to this Hubspot blog post: [Single vs Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/single-vs-multi-tenant-saas).

With TestOps Private Instance, you can benefit from:

-   Data isolation: This is helpful for users working with sensitive information and strict data storage requirements.

-   Data residency: This is helpful for users who must confirm where their data lives or have compliance requirements, for example to be in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\).

-   Dedicated Katalon application: For users who have a predictable workload and want stronger guarantees in performance, a dedicated instance ensures that they perform tests without being interrupted by maintenance or scaling issues.

-   No maintenance: While the dedicated instance offers better data isolation and performance, it is still fully managed by Katalon. This relieves customers from infrastructure management.
