# Introduction to test maintenance

Test maintenance is an integral aspect of test automation. Test maintenance is fixing tests so they stay up to date with code changes. It is also important to update your automation framework infrastructure if there are any changes to the tools or third-party libraries you use.

An automated regression test suite usually contains many tests that require test maintenance to ensure that the application is being validated properly.

Katalon Studio provides you with several methods to handle errors during test execution. These features can reduce your test maintenance effort substantially, especially when test cases run in batches overnight. You can refer to the following articles:

-   The self-healing mechanism helps you to tackle the issue of broken locators during execution. See: [Self-healing tests in Katalon Studio](/maintain/self-healing-tests-in-katalon-studio).

-   Failure handling settings allow users to decide whether Katalon Studio will continue running the test scripts if errors occur during execution. See: [Configure failure handling settings in Katalon Studio](/maintain/configure-failure-handling-settings-in-katalon-studio).

-   The time capsule mechanism allows you to view a snapshot of the application under test \(AUT\) as it was when a test failed due to locators not finding WebUI objects. See: [Fix broken web test objects with Time Capsule in Katalon Studio](/maintain/fix-broken-web-test-objects-with-time-capsule-in-katalon-studio).


You can also view and manage unused test objects, which gives you an insight into which objects are useful and which should be updated or removed. See: [Refactor test objects in Katalon Studio](/maintain/refactor-test-objects-in-katalon-studio).
