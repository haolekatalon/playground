# Run mobile native application tests on TestCloud

TestCloud allows you to perform automated tests on mobile native applications. You can upload a mobile application and tests developed locally in Katalon Studio to TestOps, and then use TestCloud to orchestrate test executions without having to set up local emulators or simulators.

This guide shows you how to perform mobile native application testing on TestCloud.

## Requirements

-   An active Katalon TestCloud subscription or trial.

-   A mobile application file in <code>.apk</code> or <code>.aab</code> format \(for Android\), or in <code>.ipa</code> format \(for iOS\).

-   A mobile test project configured in TestOps.

    -   To set up a sample project for iOS application testing, see [Open the sample iOS test project](/get-started/sample-projects/mobile/sample-ios-mobile-tests-project-in-katalon-studio#).

    -   To set up a sample project for Android application testing, see [Open the sample Android test project](/get-started/sample-projects/mobile/sample-android-mobile-tests-project-in-katalon-studio#) .
