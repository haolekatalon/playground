# Manage Desired Capabilities in Katalon Studio

From version 8.0.0 onwards, you can reuse desired capabilities across Katalon Studio projects by importing and exporting desired capabilities in a JSON file. See also [Desired capabilities](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/introduction-to-desired-capabilities-in-katalon-studio).

This is useful if you want to:

-   Reuse or copy the configured desired capabilities to another projects with some minor changes.

-   Share the configured desired capabilities for team members to reduce effort.


## Requirements

-   Katalon Studio version 8.0.0 onwards.

-   An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license. You can learn more about activating licenses in this document: Activate Katalon License.


## Export desired capabilities

1.  Go to **Project/Settings/Desired Capabilities** &gt; Choose the driver with the desired capabilities you wish to export. Click **Export**.
