# Link test execution with a TestOps release using command builder

## Requirements

You have already configured TestOps integration. [Learn more](/analyze/reports/upload-test-reports/upload-test-results-from-katalon-studio-to-katalon-testops-manually).

## Create a new Release in Katalon TestOps

You can create a new Release or use an existing Release. See: [Create and edit releases in TestOps](/plan/create-and-edit-releases-in-testops).

## Select a TestOps Release to generate command

In **Katalon Studio**, open the **Command Generator** and select a Test Suite that you want to execute in CLI.

In the **Katalon TestOps** section, select the release you want to link your execution with after running the test suite.

:::note

-   If you have not created any Releases in TestOps, it will be set as **Default Release**.


:::

After finishing the above steps, click on **Generate Command** and copy it to the command line.

## View linked execution and release in Katalon TestOps

After executing your test suite with CLI, sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your project, then go to **Planning** &gt; **Releases**. You can view the list of all releases here.
