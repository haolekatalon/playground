# Upload test scripts from the Git repository to TestOps

Katalon Platform supports uploading test scripts from a Git repository to Katalon TestOps. This allows you to manage version control and synchronization of your test project between different modules in Katalon Platform.

Katalon supports AWS CodeCommit, Azure Repos, Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab integration for Git repositories.

This article demonstrates how to upload your test scripts from a Git repository to Katalon TestOps.

## Upload test scripts from a Git repository

-   You have an existing test project in Azure Repos / Bitbucket / GitHub / GitLab / AWS CodeCommit.


To upload test scripts from a Git repository to Katalon TestOps, do as follows:

1.  Sign in [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to the project you want to upload the test scripts to.

2.  Go to **Configurations** &gt; **Script Repositories** &gt; **Connect Git Repository**. Click **Create a new Git repository**.

    The **Create a new Git repository** tab appears.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/upload-tests-via-git-repo/image/TO-Configurations-Create_a_new_git_repo_tab.png" alt="Create a new Git repository tab appears" />

3.  In the **Source Type** dropdown list, choose one of the following source types:

    -   Azure Repos
    -   Bitbucket
    -   GitHub
    -   GitLab
    -   AWS CodeCommit. When you select the **AWS CodeCommit** option, the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** fields are enabled. Currently, Katalon Studio does not support AWS CodeCommit yet.
4.  In the **Repository URL** field, enter the URL of your Git script repository. If you choose **AWS CodeCommit**, you can refer to this AWS document to retrieve the repository URL: [Step 4: Connect to the CodeCommit console and clone the repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-gc.html#setting-up-gc-connect-console).

5.  In the **Username** field, enter your Azure Repos / Bitbucket / GitHub / GitLab / AWS CodeCommit username.

6.  In the **Personal Access Token** field, enter your personal access token \(PAT\). To create a PAT, you can refer to the following documents:

    -   For Azure Repos, see this Microsoft document: [Use personal access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows).
    -   For Bitbucket, refer to this Atlassian document: [Create an App password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-an-app-password/).

    -   For GitHub, see this GitHub document: [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Make sure you opt to create a classic PAT, and select **repo** scope to set permission scopes for the PAT.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/upload-tests-via-git-repo/image/Github-Personal_access_token_permission.png" />

    -   For GitLab, refer to this GitLab document: [Personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token).

    -   For AWS CodeCommit, to create username and PAT for Git credentials, refer to this AWS document: [Step 3: Create Git credentials for HTTPS connections to CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-gc.html#setting-up-gc-iam).

7.  In the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** fields, enter your access key ID and secret access key in AWS CodeCommit. To retrieve the access key ID and secret access key, you can refer to this AWS document: [Manage access keys for IAM](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token).

8.  **Optional:** You can choose **Link existing test execution results with test cases having the same paths and names**. This option allows TestOps to attach existing test run results to the uploaded test cases and test suites that has the same paths and names.

    For example:

    -   You have an existing test run results from the **Login** test case in the <code>Test Cases/Common Test Cases</code> folder. By default, if this test case is not from an uploaded Git test project, its test results are in the **Uploaded Data** folder in the **Test Management** tab.

    -   You upload a Git repository that also has a **Login** test case in the <code>Test Cases/Common Test Cases</code> folder.

    -   You check the **Link existing test execution results with test cases having the same paths and names** option.

    -   Once the Git repository is connected successfully, in the **Test Management** tab, you can see the existing test results of the **Login** test case in the <code>&lt;your-git-repo-name&gt;/Test Cases/Common Test Cases</code> folder.

9.  Click **Connect**.

    The following sections appear:

    -   **Branch**: choose a branch.
    -   **Name**: enter your project name.
    -   **Description**: enter your Git project description \(optional\).

10. Click **Create**.


You have successfully uploaded your test scripts from a Git repository to Katalon TestOps. Next, you can start managing your test scripts in Katalon TestOps.
