# Generate browser-based videos in Katalon Studio reports

## Requirements

-   You need an active Katalon Studio Enterprise license.
-   You must be on Katalon Studio version 7.8.0 or later.
-   You need to install the FFmpeg library. See: [Install FFmpeg library](/analyze/reports/generate-test-reports/generate-browser-based-videos-in-katalon-studio-reports#).

From Katalon Studio version 7.8.0 or later, you can record and watch videos to review your failed tests. Katalon Studio supports screen-based recording and browser-based recording. To learn more about screen-based recording, see: [Generate screen-based videos in Katalon Studio reports](/analyze/reports/generate-test-reports/generate-screen-based-videos-in-katalon-studio-reports).

Use browser-based recording feature to:

-   Record video of browser window only \(even if it is hidden behind another window\).

-   Record video of Headless browser. To learn more about Headless Browser Execution, see: [Headless Browsers Execution](/execute/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio/headless-browsers-execution-in-katalon-studio).

-   Record videos of multiple browsers simultaneously \(for instance, parallel execution of Test Suite Collection\).



:::note

-   You can only record videos for Web UI testing.
-   This feature supports test suite and test suite collection execution.
-   This feature is available for Chrome, Microsoft Edge \(Chromium-based\), and Headless Chrome. To learn more about Headless Chrome, refer to the Google Developer website here: [Getting Started with Headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome)

:::

To use browser-based recording feature, you need to enable it in Katalon Studio and install a third-party library \(FFmpeg\) for video encoding.

## Enable Browser-based Recorder in Katalon Studio

Learn how to enable Browser-based Recorder in Katalon Studio.

1.  Go to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Execution**.

2.  In the **During-Execution Options** panel:

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/Generate_test_reports/record-browser-based-videos-in-Studio/images/ks-set-browser-based-recorder.png" width={700} alt="Set Browser-based Recorder in project settings" />

    -   Enable Video Recorder by checking **Record video during execution**.

    -   **Screen Recorder** is selected by default. Select **Browser-based Recorder** and choose between **All Test Cases** or **Only failed Test Cases**.

3.  Go to **Desired Capabilities** &gt; **Web UI**, then select **Chrome**, **Chrome Headless**, or **Edge Chromium**.

    Click the **Add** button, then type in the following value to set a window size of 1500x1000 for the browser to record, as shown in the sample screenshot below:

    <table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Value</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>args</td><td>List</td><td>--window-size=1500,1000</td></tr>    </tbody></table>

    To learn more about setting desired capabilities for WebUI testing, see: [Set up desired capabilities for WebUI testing](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/set-up-desired-capabilities-for-webui-testing-in-katalon-studio).

4.  Click **Apply & Close**.


## Install FFmpeg library

To install the FFmpeg library:

-   For macOS, use the following command with Homebrew:

    ```
    $ brew install ffmpeg
    ```

-   For Linux, use the following command:

    ```

    1.  Go to the [FFmpeg download web page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

    2.  Download the package for Windows.

    3.  Add the path to the FFmpeg executable file to your PATH environment variable.

    4.  Reactivate Katalon Studio for this installation to take effect.


For more information on FFmpeg library, see: [FFmpeg library](https://ffmpeg.org/).

### For Docker Image

Katalon Docker Image could be used as a container to execute Katalon Studio tests and write reports to the host's file system.

Currently, Katalon Docker Image doesnâ€™t include FFmpeg library. You can build your own image by following these steps:

1.  Create a docker image file with this content:

    ```
    FROM katalonstudio/katalon
    RUN apt-get -y update
    RUN apt-get install -y ffmpeg
    ```

2.  Build your own image. Eg:

    ```
    docker build -t mybuild .
    ```

3.  Run your docker with Katalon script. Eg:

    ```
    docker run -t --rm -v "$(pwd)":/tmp/project mybuild katalonc.sh -projectPath=/tmp/project - browserType="Chrome" -retry=0 -statusDelay=15 -testSuitePath="Test Suites/TS_RegressionTest"
                 
    ```


## View recorded videos

Click the *Play* icon in the **Video** column to play the video as shown below. Each test step in the video has a description embedded like a subtitle.

After running the test suite, navigate to the **Result** tab. You can see a list of test cases. A recorded video is attached to each test case.
