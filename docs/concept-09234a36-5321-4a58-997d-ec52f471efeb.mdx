# Perform data-driven testing in a dynamic test suite

You can perform data-driven testing by running a dynamic test suite with multiple data points.


:::note

-   Katalon Studio Enterprise version 8.3.0 onwards.

:::

Follow these steps:

1.  Configure data binding for the test cases. See: [Data-driven testing at the test case level](/create-tests/data-driven-testing/data-driven-testing-at-the-test-case-level-in-katalon-studio).

2.  Add the associated test cases to a dynamic test suite via a search query. See above: [Add test cases to a dynamic test suite](/organize/manage-tests/dynamic-test-suite/manage-dynamic-test-suites-in-katalon-studio#).

3.  Hit **Run** to execute the dynamic test suite. Test cases in the dynamic test suite are then executed with the configured test data.

4.  Verify the data binding and test execution results in **Log Viewer**.
