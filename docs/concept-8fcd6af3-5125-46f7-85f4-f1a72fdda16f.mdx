# Create an organization and project

To use Katalon Platform, you need to set up an account to manage your Katalon subscriptions, and an organization to manage your Katalon teams and projects.

By default, **TestOps** creates an account, an organization, and a project when you first sign up.

This document shows you how to manually create an organization and project in Katalon Platform.

## Create an organization

You need a Katalon account. Register for a [Katalon account](https://www.katalon.com/sign-up/) if you don't have one.

By creating an organization, team members can collaborate across several projects instantly.

You can also join any other organization you are invited to.

Follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login).

    The **TestOps Homepage** appears with the current organization.

2.  Click on the dropdown button on the top left and select **Create new Organization**.

## Transfer Ownership


:::note

-   You must be the Owner of your Organization.


:::

You may want to transfer ownership in the following circumstances:

-   When you want to change your current email address.
-   When you want to transfer your Organization to another member.

### Transfer ownership to a new email address

As an Owner of an Organization, the email address you have registered with Katalon TestOps is bound to your TestOps Organization and becomes a unique ID. You cannot change this unique ID.

If you want to change your email address, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new account using your new email address.
2.  Send an invitation to join the Organization to the new email address. See: [Invite users to join an Organization](/administer/administration-tasks/user-management/manage-users#).
3.  Join the Organization as a new user. See: [Join TestOps Organizations](/administer/administration-tasks/join-a-testops-organization).
4.  Transfer ownership to the new email address. See: [Transfer Ownership](/administer/administration-tasks/user-management/transfer-ownership#).
5.  Delete the old account. See: [Remove existing users](/administer/administration-tasks/user-management/manage-users#).

### Transfer ownership to an existing member


:::note

-   You have invited the user to join your Organization. See: [Invite users to join an Organization](/administer/administration-tasks/user-management/manage-users#).


:::

Follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login).

2.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **User Management**.

    The **User Management** page appears. You can see a list of active members in the **Active Users** section.

3.  Mouse over the member you want to select, then click on the *Extension* icon at the end of the row.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-nov-release-transfer-ownership/transfer-owner-role-button.png" alt="extension icon click" />

5.  Check the email address you want to transfer ownership to.

6.  Enter your account's password for authentication.

7.  Click on the red **Transfer Owner Role** button to finish.

    
    :::note

    -   You cannot undo this action.

    :::


You have transferred the Organization to the selected email address/member.

That member is now the Owner of your Organization. The new Owner has all privileges \(including ownership transfering\) in the Organization. See: [Roles and permissions](/administer/administration-roles/administrative-roles-and-permissions).

After transfering ownership, your role has automatically become the **Admin** role.


:::note

-   Transferring Organization ownership does not affect Team ownership. The previous Organization Owner maintains Owner permissions for the Teams they have created.
