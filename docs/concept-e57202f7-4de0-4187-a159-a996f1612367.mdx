# Windows Record Tutorials in Katalon Studio


:::note

-   WinAppDriver is running on the test machine. To learn how to set up and run WinAppDriver, see: [Set up WinAppDriver](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/windows-desktop-apps-testing/set-up-winappdriver-in-katalon-studio).

:::


:::note

-   From version 7.0.0 onwards, you can record a test on a Windows desktop application.
-   From version 7.8.0 onwards, Katalon supports recording and locating a Windows element by its relative coordinates.

:::

## Coordinate-based Recording

In the Recorder, the two buttons, including **Click Element Offset** and **Right-click Element Offset** are added to **Possible Actions**, and the following keywords are supported:

-   [\[Windows\] Click Element Offset](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/windows-keywords/windows-click-element-offset)
-   [\[Windows\] Right-click Element Offset](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/windows-keywords/windows-right-click-element-offset)

With coordinates-based recording, Katalon Studio records an element's relative coordinates in addition to its selector. For instance, you want to click on the red X part to close a tab in Notepad. Katalon Recorder records the button's offsets \(its relative coordinates to its top-left corner\) as a set of parameters representing an X and Y offset, and save them in clickElementOffset. It uses them to identify the exact location to perform a click action during runtime.

Without that element's offsets, the test engine can only click on the button's center, resulting in a failed test.

## Recording

1.  To start recording a Windows action, Click the **Record Windows Action** icon on the main toolbar of Katalon Studio.

2.  The Windows Recorder dialog box is displayed. Specify the information at the **CONFIGURATIONS** section.

    -   **Configuration**: where you can view and edit the <code>WinAppDriver URL</code> and <code>Desired Capabilities</code>.

    -   **Application File**: the absolute path to the <code>Windows Executable File (&lt;.exe)</code> of the testing machine. For Windows users, click **Browse...** button to locate the application file.

        The **Start** button is enabled after the Application File text box is filled.

        Click **Start** when you're done with the settings.

3.  The specified Windows application is deployed and opened on a testing machine.

4.  The **Screen View** dialog box is displayed to show the current screenshot of your application on the testing machine.

    All the Windows objects in that screenshot are analyzed and organized in a tree at the **Screen Objects** section.

    Click on any object in that tree and it's highlighted in the Screen View accordingly.

5.  Select an element, then specify an action to perform at the **Possible Actions** section.

6.  All of the specified actions above are recorded at the **Recorded Actions** section.

    In **Captured Objects**, you can view all elements captured during the recording session. Here you can customize the locator of a captured object by modifying it in the Locator tab of **Object Properties** and clicking **Highlight** to verify if the new locator correctly identifies the intended object.

7.  You can stop the application or start another application if needed. To reload the **Screen View** as well as **Screen Objects**, simply click on the **Refresh Screen** button. When youâ€™re done with recording, click **OK** to save the recorded actions in Katalon Studio.

8.  You will be prompted to save the captured objects in the Object Repository of Katalon Studio. Choose an existing folder or create a new one, then click **OK** to continue.

9.  When you finish your recording session, export the recorded steps to a new test case.

10. Recorded objects and actions are saved in the test case.

## Executing a test case

Select the **Windows** icon in the **Run** button on the main Toolbar to execute the script.

The Windows test is executed with those recorded steps accordingly.


:::note

1.  Remember not to lock your screen while spying, recording or executing a test on a desktop application.
2.  You're recommended not to run multiple applications simultaneously.
3.  To start a UWP application, the application's execute file should be:

-   *ApplicationID* if your app is published on Microsoft store.
-   *PackageFamilyName!Application ID* if your app is still in development.
