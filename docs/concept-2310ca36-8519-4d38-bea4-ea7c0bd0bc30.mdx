## Write your first test case

This tutorial focuses on how to create a Web test case using the Web Record Utility in Katalon Studio. You can perform all the desired actions as a real user on your website while the Web Record Utility records them.

If you have other project types, see the corresponding guides for [Mobile](/create-tests/record-and-spy/mobile-record-and-spy-utilities/record-mobile-utility-in-katalon-studio), [Desktop](/create-tests/record-and-spy/windows-record-and-spy-utilities/windows-record-utility-in-katalon-studio), [API](/create-tests/create-test-cases/create-your-first-api-test-with-katalon-studio#), and [BDD](/create-tests/create-test-cases/create-bdd-test-cases-in-katalon-studio).

The application under test \(AUT\) is a demo website called CURA Healthcare Service: <code>https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/</code>.

You can clone the sample project here: [Healthcare sample](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/healthcare-tests).

1.  From the main toolbar, click on **Record Web** to open the **Web Recorder**.
