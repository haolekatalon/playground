# Use the Self-Healing function in Katalon Recorder

On some websites, automation scripts can fail because the default locator fails to find an element. In that case, Self-Healing will automatically try out other locators. If it finds a valid locator, it will continue the automation script using that locator and records the broken and valid locators for later use.

## Enabling and disabling Self-Healing

Self-healing is enabled by default.

You can disable it by following these steps:

1.  Go to **Settings &gt; Self-Healing**.

2.  Uncheck **Enable Self-Healing execution**.

3.  Save and close.

## Prioritizing locator methods in Self-Healing

Self-Healing uses 3 locator methods, in this priority order: **id**, **css**, **xpath**. However, the best locator methods may vary depending on your websites under test.

You can change the order of locator methods by following these steps:

1.  Go to **Settings &gt; Self-Healing**.

2.  Make sure Self-Healing is enabled.

3.  Drag and drop the locator methods in the order of your choosing.

4.  Save and close.


## Excluding certain commands from Self-Healing


:::note

Some commands validate that a particular element exists on a certain page. We advise you to not trigger Self-Healing on these commands, as it encurs the risk of validating elements incorrectly.

By default, <code>verifyElementPresent</code>, <code>verifyElementNotPresent</code>, <code>assertElementPresent</code> and <code>assertElementNotPresent</code> commands are excluded from Self-Healing.

:::

You can choose to exclude certain commands from Self-Healing by following these steps:

1.  Go to **Settings &gt; Self-Healing**.

2.  Make sure Self-Healing is enabled.

3.  Add the commands you want to exclude to the list.

4.  Save and close.



:::note

Regex is also supported for excluding commands. For example, you can exclude all command starting with the keyword **waitFor** by adding **^waitFor** to the list.

## Approving Self-Healing proposals

When the default locator fails, Self-Healing finds alternative locators to complete the test execution. After the test execution is completed, you can choose to replace failing locators by approving Self-Healing suggestions.

The Self-Healing tab is refreshed on every new execution.

To approve Self-healing suggestions, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the Self-Healing tab.

2.  Select the suggested locators using the status filter.

3.  Press **Approve**.
