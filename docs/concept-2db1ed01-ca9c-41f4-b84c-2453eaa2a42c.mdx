# Schedule Test Runs in TestOps

## Requirements

-   You have created a [Local Test Environment with Agent](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/create-a-local-test-environment-with-an-agent) or you have already created a different Test Environment \(Docker, Kubernetes, etc.\).

-   You have created a Git script repository and linked it to your project on TestOps. For more information, see [Upload test scripts from the Git repository to TestOps](/organize/upload-test-scripts-from-a-git-repository/upload-test-scripts-from-the-git-repository-to-testops).


## Schedule Test Runs

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to your Project and select the **Test Execution** tab.

    The **Test Run Calendar** page appears as below.

2.  Click on the **Schedule Test Run** button.

    The **Schedule Test Run** dialog appears as below.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-june-schedule-test-runs/kt-schedule-test-run-page-ui-jun22.png" alt="schedule test run page ui jun22" /><img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-june-schedule-test-runs/kt-schedule-test-run-page-visual-testing-section-ui-jun22.png" alt="schedule test run page visual testing section ui jun22" />

3.  Fill in the information.

    -   In the **General Information** section, create a name for the schedule.
    -   In the **What to run** section, fill in the following information:

        -   **Script Repository**: select your repository in the dropdown list.

            
            :::note

            -   Katalon TestOps currently supports test scripts from Katalon Studio and Git Repositories \(Azure Repos, Bitbucket, GitHub and GitLab\). See: [Upload Test Scripts from a Git Repository](/organize/upload-test-scripts-from-a-git-repository/upload-test-scripts-from-the-git-repository-to-testops).

            :::

        -   **Type**: choose between **Test Suite**, **Test Suite Collection**, **Katalon Command** and **Generic Command** to run your tests.

            
            :::note

            -   You choose **Test Suite** if you want to run test suites created in TestOps or from Katalon Studio \(KS\).

                -   Make sure you download a new local agent to execute test suites in the local environment. See: [Create a Local Test Environment with an Agent](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/create-a-local-test-environment-with-an-agent).

                -   Make sure Kobiton integration is disabled because you can only execute test suites on desktop applications \(browsers\). You can toggle **Kobiton** off in advanced settings. See: [Advanced settings](/execute/schedule-test-execution/schedule-test-runs-in-testops#).

                -   Once you have chosen **Test Suite**, the **Run with** section appears. The default browser is Chrome. You can select a different browser in the **Run with** section.

            -   You choose **Test Suite Collection** if you want to select the Test Suite Collections directly from KS. Katalon TestOps will automatically fetch your Test Suite Collections.

            -   The **Visual Testing** option is enabled.

                -   You can specify an existing baseline collection in the **Visual Testing** section to associate it with the scheduled test runs.

                -   If you do not specify a baseline collection, TestOps automatically generates a new baseline collection when the test run schedule is executed.

                -   For more information on visual testing, see: [TestOps Visual Testing](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/visual-testing-overview#) and [Use TestOps Visual Testing](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/use-testops-visual-testing).

            -   You choose **Generic Command** if you want to execute tests with other frameworks outside KS \(e.g., Pytest\).
            -   You choose **Katalon Command** if you want to execute tests with KS. The Katalon commands can be generated from KS \(in the **Command Generator** dialog\). See: [Command Syntax](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/command-line-syntax-in-katalon-runtime-engine).
            :::

    -   In the **Where to run** section, fill in the following information:

        -   **Test Environment Type**: choose among **Local Test Environment**, **TestCloud Test Environment**, **Kubernetes Test Environment** or **CircleCI Test Environment**.

            
            :::note

            -   If you are using Katalon Runtime Engine \(KRE\), check the **Katalon Runtime Engine Version** box and select the version you are using from the dropdown list.

            -   If you choose **Test Cloud Environment** to run test suites, the browser options in the **TestCloud** section correspond to the browser you have selected in the **Run with** section \(when selecting **Test Suite** as **Type** in the **What to run** section\). For example, if the selected browser is Chrome, the available options in the **TestCloud** section are: Window - Chrome and Linux - Chrome. See also: [Integrate TestCloud with TestOps](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testcloud/use-testcloud-in-testops).

            :::

        -   **Test Environments**: select the Agents you want to use for test executions.

    -   In the **When to run** section, you have the following options:

        -   If you want to run tests periodically, select **Trigger Automated Test**, turn the **Repeat** toggle on, set the time period and the interval you want to run the tests \(e.g., run tests every **2 days** from **09/21/2021 10:49** to **10/20/2021 11:00**\), then click **Schedule**. You have created a trigger to run tests automatically.

            <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-june-schedule-test-runs/kt-schedule-test-run-page-ui-jun22.png" alt="schedule test run page ui jun22" />

        -   If you want to run tests immediately, select **Trigger Automated Test**, turn the **Repeat** toggle off, then click **Run**. You have run the tests manually.

            <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-june-schedule-test-runs/kt-schedule-test-run-repeat-off-ui-jun22.png" alt="schedule test run page repeat off ui jun22" />

        -   If you want to save what you have configured so far without running tests, select **Save Configurations**, then click **Save**. You then can come back another time to run tests manually. See: [Execute Test Runs manually](/execute/schedule-test-execution/execute-test-runs-manually-in-testops).

            <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-june-schedule-test-runs/kt-schedule-test-run-save-configuration-ui-jun22.png" alt="schedule test run page save configuration ui jun22" />


## Advanced settings

You can optimize your configurations in the **Advanced settings** section of the **Schedule Test Run** dialog.

When you open the **Schedule Test Run** dialog, at the bottom left corner, click **Advanced settings**.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Schedule_test_executions/Schedule-test-runs-in-testops/image/tc-schedule-test-run.png" width={850} alt="Schedule test run advanced settings" />

The dialog displays with the following settings:

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Schedule_test_executions/Schedule-test-runs-in-testops/image/tc-advanced-setting.png" />

-   **Visual Testing**: select a Baseline Collection ID or generate a new Baseline Collection to compare with the captured images.

-   **Katalon Runtime Engine Version**: choose a Katalon Runtime Engine version to run your test.

-   **Execution Mode**: choose between **Sequential** \(run one test after another\) or **Parallel** \(run tests at the same time\). See: [Run multiple Test Suites in parallel with Agents](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/run-multiple-test-suites-in-parallel-with-agents).

    
    :::note

    -   You can only run test suites in a sequential mode. If you choose **Test Suite**, there is no **Parallel** option.
    :::

-   **Integration**:

    -   For **Xray Test Plan** and **Xray Push Mechanism**: see [Link a Katalon test run with an Xray test plan](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/xray-integration/link-a-katalon-test-run-with-an-xray-test-plan).
    -   For **Kobiton**: switch the **Kobiton** toggle on to enable the integration, then enter your Kobiton Device ID to run tests on that device. See: [How to configure Kobiton integration with Katalon TestOps](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/integration-with-other-vendors-for-cloud-execution/kobiton-integration/kobiton-integration-with-testops).
-   **Custom Field** & **Tag**: assign custom fields and tags to your test run schedule. See: [Custom Fields and Tags](/organize/custom-field-and-tags/custom-fields-and-tags).

-   **Release Version**: select the release version you want to link your test runs to. See: [Manage Test Runs by Release](/plan/create-and-edit-releases-in-testops).

-   **Timeout in Minutes**: define the time after which test execution is canceled. Add more minutes to this limit to avoid test executions getting timed out before completion.


After creating the schedule, Katalon TestOps automatically directs you to the **Test Run List** page.

The **Test Run List** page shows you a collection of Test Runs with the same configurations \(Test Environment, Script Repository\).

## View test run types in Katalon Studio

-   This feature is available from Katalon Studio version 7.9.1 onwards.
-   You have enabled TestOps integration in Katalon Studio. See: Katalon Studio Integration.

The **Test Run List** in TestOps is equivalent to the **Test Run Types** in Katalon Studio.

Follows these steps:

1.  Open your project in Katalon Studio.

2.  In the **Tests Explorer** sidebar, go to **TestOps** &gt; **Test Run Types**.

    You can view a summary of Test Run Types that have been configured in TestOps.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Schedule_test_executions/Schedule-test-runs-in-testops/image/KS-TESTOPS-Test-run-types.png" width={850} />

3.  Click on one of the Test Run names. This opens the Test Runs Summary page in Katalon TestOps.
