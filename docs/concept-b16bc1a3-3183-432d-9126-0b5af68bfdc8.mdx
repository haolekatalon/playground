# Debug a test case in Katalon Studio

Creating automation test cases is a repetitive task that requires a lot of editing and re-running test cases. In many automation tools, when a test case fails and you make certain changes to the script, you usually have to execute the whole script all over again to make sure the test is executed as expected.

To save your precious time from tedious repetitive re-running all unnecessary steps for debugging and to make debugging easier, Katalon Studio provides the following utilities:

-   Debug: Run from here
-   Debug: Enable/Disable steps
-   Debug mode
-   Debug from here

## Requirements

-   An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license.

## Debug: Run from here

With this feature, you can resume the existing execution quickly. Katalon Studio currently supports **Run from here** with **Chrome, Firefox, and Edge Chromium** \(Edge Chromium is supported in versio 7.3.0 and later\) only. To use it, from the [Manual view](/create-tests/create-test-cases/create-test-case-overview) of a test case:

1.  Start a browser with the <code>Open Browser</code> step, or you must have a currently running browser.
2.  Make sure this browser's session is NOT terminated when the execution finishes \(Go to **Project/Settings/Execution** and uncheck the **Terminate...** options in **Post-Execution Options** based on your testing needs\)

3.  In the Manual view of the test case, right-click on a step, select **Run from here** and select one of the **currently running** browser instances to execute your test.

    
    :::note

    -   If there are no running browser instances that are previously launched in Katalon Studio, **Run from here** is disabled.

    **Debug: Enable or Disable steps**

## Debug: Enable or Disable Steps

Katalon Studio allows you to enable or disable one or more test steps before executing the test case to skip unwanted steps during execution. You can use the provided keyboard shortcuts to perform the actions.

-   For Windows: **Ctrl+D** \(disable\) and **Ctrl+E** \(enable\) on selected steps.
-   For macOS: **command+/** \(disable\) and **option+command+/**

## Debug mode

The Debug mode in Katalon Studio is designed to make debugging easy to use, allowing investigating the root causes more quickly. The following steps present how to debug a test case:

1.  Open a test case and switch to the **Script** view.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/debugging_test_case/Script-view.png" alt="Script view Katalon Studio" />

2.  Double-click on the leftmost side of the script editor to mark a breakpoint. A breakpoint is where Katalon Studio pauses the test execution for you to start debugging.

3.  Choose a browser for **Debug** from the main toolbar.

4.  Confirm \(select **Yes**\) when being asked to display the **Debug** perspective.

5.  The **Debug** perspective provides convenient options for debugging purposes. You can:

    -   Navigate execution using commands from the debug toolbar

## Debug from here


:::note

-   Introduced in version **7.5.5**.

:::

To use **Debug from here** with **Chrome, Firefox, or Edge Chromium**, do as follows:

1.  Start a browser with the <code>Open Browser</code> step, or you must have a currently running browser
2.  Make sure this browser's session is NOT terminated when the execution finishes \(Go to **Project/Settings/Execution** and uncheck the **Terminate...** options in **Post-Execution Options** based on your testing needs\)

3.  Open a test case in its **Script** view and double-click on the leftmost side of the script editor to mark a breakpoint. A breakpoint is where Katalon Studio pauses the test execution for you to debug.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/execute-a-test-case-or-a-test-suite/breakpoint.png" />

4.  Switch to the test case's **Manual** view, right-click on a step, select **Debug from here** and select one of the **currently running** browser instances to execute your test.

    
    :::note

    -   If there are no running browser instances that are previously launched in Katalon Studio, **Debug from here...** is disabled.
