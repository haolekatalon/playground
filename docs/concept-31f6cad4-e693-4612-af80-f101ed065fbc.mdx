## Create webhook for TestOps - Jira integration

-   You must be the Owner or Administrator of your organization


We use Jira webhook to notify Katalon Platform when specific events happen in Jira. For instance, Jira can alert Defect Reports when a defect-linked Jira issue's status or priority is updated. By using a webhook, Jira issue lifecycle changes can be reflected on Katalon Platform in real-time without any manual intervention from users. This allows for seamless and efficient coordination between Jira and Katalon Platform, providing users with up-to-date information without any delay.

1.  On TestOps, go to **Configurations** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Jira/Xray**, scroll down to Webhook.

    If you don't see the Webhook section, [set up Jira integration first](https://docs.katalon.com/docs/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/jira-integration/enable-katalon-testops---jira-integration-for-test-management). <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Integration_For_Organizing_Tests/Jira_Integration/Enable-Jira-TestOps-integration/Image/TO-Configurations-Jira_Webhook.png" alt="Jira webhook integration" />

2.  Select **Create Webhook**, and copy the Webhook URL.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Integration_For_Organizing_Tests/Jira_Integration/Enable-Jira-TestOps-integration/Image/TO-Jira_webhook-copy_URL.png" alt="Copy jira webhook URL" />

3.  Open your Jira portal, go to **Jira Settings** &gt; **Webhook** &gt; **Create a Webhook**. Paste the Webhook URL from TestOps to the URL field. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Integration_For_Organizing_Tests/Jira_Integration/Enable-Jira-TestOps-integration/Image/TO-Jira_webhook-_copy_paste_URL_to_jira.png" alt="Paste jira webhook URL" />

4.  Set up Jira events scope for the Webhook by selecting **Issue**: **created**, **updated**, **deleted**. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Integration_For_Organizing_Tests/Jira_Integration/Enable-Jira-TestOps-integration/Image/TO-Jira_webhook_scopes_selection.png" alt="Select jira webhook scopes" />

    Uncheck the **Exclude Body** option: <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Integration_For_Organizing_Tests/Jira_Integration/Enable-Jira-TestOps-integration/Image/Jira_webhook_-_uncheck_Exclude_body.png" alt="uncheck Exclude body option" />Finally, select **Create** at the bottom of the screen.
