# Import web service requests from SoapUI to Katalon Studio

Starting version 7.8.0, you can import SOAP requests from a [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/getting-started/) to Katalon Studio. It is already possible to import RESTful requests from a SoapUI since version 7.6.0.

To import a REST/SOAP test request from a SoapUI to Katalon Studio, perform the following steps:

1.  Create or open an API/Web Service project.

2.  Click the **Import Services from SoapUI** icon.

    Alternately, you can import REST/SOAP test requests via the **Tests Explorer** panel. Right-click on **Object Repository** &gt; **Import** &gt; **From SoapUI**.

3.  In the dialog that displays, browse to your **SoapUI** project and click **OK**.

    Katalon Studio loads the file and generates the RESTful/SOAP request objects accordingly.
