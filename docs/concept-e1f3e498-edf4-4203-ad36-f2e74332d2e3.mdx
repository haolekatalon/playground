# Basic Search For Dynamic Test Suite


:::note

-   From version 8.5.0, **Test Case Management With Tags** and **Basic Search For Dynamic Test Suite** becomes the official built-in feature of Katalon Studio. See [Manage dynamic test suites in Katalon Studio](/organize/manage-tests/dynamic-test-suite/manage-dynamic-test-suites-in-katalon-studio).


:::

[Dynamic Test Suite](/organize/manage-tests/test-suite/manage-test-suites-in-katalon-studio#) allows you to define the query search and manage query plugins from Katalon Store. [Basic Search For Dynamic Test Suite](https://store.katalon.com/product/2/Basic-Search-For-Dynamic-Test-Suite) is one of them. This plugin enables basic search capabilities to look for test cases faster in Katalon Studio and help filter which test cases to be executed.

1.  Create a new dynamic test suite by a right-click on **Test Suite &gt; New &gt; Dynamic Test Suite**.

2.  Add test cases to the dynamic test suite NOT in a manual way but via [search query](/organize/manage-workspace/search-test-cases-in-katalon-studio). Enter the search condition, click **Preview** to query out the matching test cases and the total number of results.

    For example, to add the test cases in the â€œCustom-keyword samples" folder to this dynamic test suite, you can use this search query:

    ```
    id=(Test Cases/Simple Examples/Katalon Shop/Custom-keyword samples)
    ```

    .

    Test cases that match the search conditions are chosen when the test suites are executed \(unlike in built-in test suites, test cases are chosen at planning time\).
