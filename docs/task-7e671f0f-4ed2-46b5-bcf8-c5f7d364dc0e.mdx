4.  There are two ways to download test result files:

    1.  Click the Download icon on the right side along the test run name to download all report files. You can select the file extension format you wish to download the report in \(.csv, .xlsx, .pdf, or .zip\). This type of report is generated by TestOps and gives you a summary instead of detail steps. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/View_test_run_results/View_test_run_results_and_execution_logs/Image/TO-Reports-Download_all_.png" alt="download all test report files" />

    2.  Alternatively, hover over an individual test result file and click the Download icon to download the report file. These are the detailed reports uploaded to TestOps by Katalon Studio. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/View_test_run_results/View_test_run_results_and_execution_logs/Download_test_report_file/Image/TO-Reports-Test_Runs-download_individual_file.png" alt="download individual report files" />This type of report will cover all the steps if your Katalon Studio setting is enabled with Log executed test steps. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/View_test_run_results/View_test_run_results_and_execution_logs/Download_test_report_file/Image/KStudio-_log_executed_test_steps.jpeg" width={500} alt="Katalon Studio log executed test steps" />
