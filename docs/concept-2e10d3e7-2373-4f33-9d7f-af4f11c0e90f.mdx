# Working with BDD feature files in Katalon Studio

Learn how to work with BDD feature files in Katalon Studio.

## Add Feature Files

This section shows you how to add feature files in Katalon Studio. Steps in the scenario will then be defined by step definitions.

To add a new feature files in Katalon Studio, do as follows:

1.  In Katalon Studio, open a Katalon project. Then, navigate to **Test Explorer** &gt; **Include** &gt; **features**. Right-click on the **features** folder and choose **New Feature File**.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-840-create-new-feature-file.png" width={500} alt="create new feature file" />

2.  The **New Feature File** dialog appears. Give your feature file a name. You may also choose to **Generate sample Feature template**. This option ensures that the created features file matches with BDD convention.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-840-new-feature-file.png" width={400} alt="new feature file" />

    A new feature file is created.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-840-new-feature-file-sample.png" width={750} alt="new feature file" />

3.  Add your scenarios to the feature file following the sample format:

    -   Feature: List of scenarios.

    -   Scenario: Business rule through list of steps with arguments.

    -   Scenario Outline: Used where test data is replaced with multiple sets of data for each run of a test script.

    -   Given: Precondition step.

    -   When: Key actions.

    -   Then: Observe outcomes or validation.

    -   And, But: Enumerate more **Given, When, Then** steps.

    -   Background: List of steps run before each of the scenarios.

    -   Examples: Container for data set.

    -   Tags/ Labels: To group relevant scenarios. Using tags is a good way to organize features and scenario. A feature or scenario may have multiple tags.

    For example, to test the Login feature of the Katalon Demo Cura System \(<code>https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/</code>\), there are two scenario outlines: login with a valid credential, and login with an invalid credential. In each scenario, there are specific **Given, When, Then** steps as shown below:

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-840-login-feature-file.png" width={700} alt="log in feature file" />

    **Sample Feature File Script:**

    ```
    #Author: your.email@your.domain.com
    #Keywords Summary :
    #Feature: List of scenarios.
    #Scenario: Business rule through list of steps with arguments.
    #Given: Some precondition step
    #When: Some key actions
    #Then: To observe outcomes or validation
    #And,But: To enumerate more Given,When,Then steps
    #Scenario Outline: List of steps for data-driven as an Examples and <placeholder>
    #Examples: Container for s table
    #Background: List of steps run before each of the scenarios
    #""" (Doc Strings)
    #| (Data Tables)
    #@ (Tags/Labels):To group Scenarios
    #<> (placeholder)
    #""
    ## (Comments)
    #Sample Feature Definition Template
    @Login
    Feature: Login Feature
    
      As a user, I want to login to Cura System
      so that I can make an appointment.
    
      @Valid
      Scenario Outline: Login with a valid credential
        Given I navigate to Cura System homepage
        When I click Make Appointment button
        And I enter username <username> and password <password>
        And I click Log in button 
        Then I should be able to login successfully
    
        Examples: 
          | username | password           |
          | John Doe | ThisIsNotAPassword |
    
      @InValid
      Scenario Outline: Login with an invalid credential
        Given I navigate to Cura System homepage
        When I click Make Appointment button
        And I enter an invalid username <username> and password <password>
        And I click Log in button
        Then I should NOT be able to login successfully
    
        Examples: 
          | username | password           |
          | Jane Doe | ThisIsNotAPassword |
    ```


## Maintain Features File


:::note

-   Katalon Studio code inspection can detect and highlight any missing Step Definitions in Features File to help you create the required step definitions.


:::

For better management, organize your feature files with a multi-level system. A feature file can contain many scenarios. However, you should have one scenario per feature file for easy maintenance.

In Katalon Studio, there are three options to help you maintain the feature file. Right-click anywhere in the feature file editor view and choose from the following options:

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-maintain-feature-file.png" width={700} />

<table><tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Pretty Format</td><td>Re-do the format when the current format is not organized properly.</td></tr><tr><td>Find Step</td><td><p>Find relevant step of current Gherkin step in existing <strong>Step Definitions</strong> files.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Recalculate steps</td><td>Recalculate steps in the feature file when there are changes in <strong>Step Definitions</strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Define Steps

### Steps definitions

After you added your feature files, you need to define and link steps before using the features file.

Each Gherkin step in the features file needs to be defined as a set of programming code so that Katalon Studio can execute the action of that step. These step definitions can be implemented in the **Keyword** folder by leveraging the **Script Mode**.

Katalon Studio built-in keywords can also be re-used in **Step Definition** files as well. When Katalon Studio executes any features files in a test case, it also looks for the matching step definitions in the source folder.

**Step Definitions** can be written in any Cucumber-supported programming languages, including Groovy and Java.

For example, for two scenario outlines \(Login with a valid credential and login with an invalid credential\), there are six \(6\) steps defined as shown below:

-   Given I navigate to Cura System homepage

-   When I click Make Appointment button

-   And I enter username &lt;username&gt; and password &lt;password&gt;

-   And I click Log in button

-   Then I should be able to login successfully

-   Then I should NOT be able to login successfully


<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-840-step-definition.png" width={750} alt="step definition" />

**Step Definitions Sample Script**

```
class MyStepDefinition {

    /**
     * The step definitions below match with Katalon sample Gherkin steps
     */

    @Given("I navigate to Cura System homepage")
    def I_navigate_to_Cura_System_homepage() {

        WebUI.openBrowser("https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/")
        //WebUI.waitForPageLoad(30)
    }

    @When("I click Make Appointment button")
    def I_click_makeAppointment_button() {

        WebUI.click(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/a_Make Appointment'))
    }
 
    @And("I enter username (.*) and password (.*)")
    def I_enter_valid_username_password(String username, String password) {

        WebUI.setText(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/input_userName'), username)
        WebUI.setText(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/input_password'), password)
    }
 
    @And("I click Log in button")
    def I_click_login_btn() {

        WebUI.click(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/button_Login'))
    }
 
    @Then("I should be able to login successfully")
    def I_login_successfully() {

        WebUI.click(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/button_Login'))
        WebUI.verifyTextPresent('Make Appointment', false)
        WebUI.closeBrowser()
    }

    @And("I enter an invalid username (.*) and password (.*)")
    def I_enter_invalid_username_password(String username, String password) {

        WebUI.setText(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/input_userName'), username)
        WebUI.setText(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/input_password'), password)
    }

 
    @Then("I should NOT be able to login successfully")
    def I_login_unsuccessfully() {

        WebUI.verifyTextPresent('Login failed! Please ensure the username and password are valid.', false)
        WebUI.closeBrowser()
    }

}


```

#### How to define steps

Steps in the feature files must be defined before use.

To create new step definitions, follow these steps:

1.  In **Test Explorer**, navigate to the **Include/scripts/groovy** folder. Right-click and choose **New** &gt; **Step Definition**.

    The **Keyword** dialog appears.

2.  Choose your **Package**, then enter your **Class Name**. You may also enable the option to **Generate sample @Given, @When, @Then steps**.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-840-keyword.png" width={500} alt="keyword" />

3.  Once you are done, click **OK**.


A new step definition is created.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-840-new-step-definition.png" width={750} alt="new step definition" />

### Set the default package for step definitions


:::note

-   This capability is only available for Katalon Studio 7.8.0 and later.

:::

You can define the location of a step definitions for Cucumber by using <code>CucumberKW.GLUE = ['package1', 'package2']</code>. The default value of <code>CucumberKW.GLUE = ['']</code> is all packages, which means the test engine takes time to scan all the packages. Defining specific locations narrows down the packages to find the steps definitions before executing feature files; hence, reducing the execution time.

We recommend putting the script of directing to a package in a test listener.

```
import com.kms.katalon.core.annotation.AfterTestCase
import com.kms.katalon.core.annotation.BeforeTestCase
import com.kms.katalon.core.context.TestCaseContext
import com.kms.katalon.core.cucumber.keyword.CucumberBuiltinKeywords as CucumberKW

class NewTestListener {
    @BeforeTestCase
    def sampleBeforeTestCase(TestCaseContext testCaseContext) {
        CucumberKW.GLUE = ['package1', 'package2']
    }
}

```

## Run a Feature File

Katalon Studio allows you to run the features file instantly by itself to make sure it works properly.

To do so, open the desired **Features** file, then click the **Run** button on the main toolbar, as shown below:

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/run-feature-file.png" width={400} />

## Set up Cucumber Hooks

### Create Cucumber Features file

To apply hooks in the Cucumber BDD test, you need to create a Cucumber Features file firstand its corresponding step definitions.

1.  To create a Cucumber Features file, go to **File** &gt; **New** &gt; **BDD Feature File**.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/ks-840-new-feature-file.png" width={400} alt="new BDD feature file" />

    Tick the **Generate sample Feature template** option for a sample features file.

    The script below is a generated sample features template:

    ```
    #Sample Feature Definition Template
    @tag
    Feature: Title of your feature
    I want to use this template for my feature file
    
    @tag1
    Scenario Outline: Title of your scenario outline
        Given I want to write a step with <name>
        When I check for the <value> in step
        Then I verify the <status> in step
    
        Examples: 
        | name  | value | status  |
        | name1 |     5 | success |
        | name2 |     7 | Fail    |
    ```

2.  To create step definitions, go to **File** &gt; **New** &gt; **Groovy Script**.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Test_Artifacts/Working_With_BDD_Feature_File/image/KS-create-step-defintions.png" width={400} alt="Create step definition" />

    
    :::caution

    -   You can only use custom keywords with BDD testing when the step definition belongs to the default package. If the package is different from the default package, you cannot call the custom keyword.
    :::

    Tick the **Generate sample @Given, @When, @Then steps** for sample step definitions.

    The script below is a generated sample @Given, @When, @Then steps:

    ```
    class Sample {
    
        /**
        * The step definitions below match with Katalon sample Gherkin steps
        */
        @Given("I want to write a step with (.*)")
        def I_want_to_write_a_step_with_name(String name) {
            println name
        }
    
        @When("I check for the (\\d+) in step")
        def I_check_for_the_value_in_step(int value) {
            println value
        }
    
        @Then("I verify the (.*) in step")
        def I_verify_the_status_in_step(String status) {
            println status
        }
    }
    
    
    ```


### Add Cucumber Hooks

1.  Create another step definition or a custom keyword that includes the Cucumber hooks. Here, we create a step definition.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/cucumber-test-hooks/KS-New-Cucumber-hooks-script.png" alt="New Cucumber hook script" />

2.  Enter Cucumber hooks into the new step definition. For example, to add <code>@Before</code> and <code>@After</code> scenario hooks, copy and paste the following script:

    ```
    class SampleTestHook {
        @Before
        public void beforeScenario(Scenario scenario) {
            println 'This is a before scenario method: ' + scenario.getName()
        }
    
        @After
        public void afterScenario(Scenario scenario) {
            println 'This is a after scenario method: ' + scenario.getName()
        }
    }
    
    ```
