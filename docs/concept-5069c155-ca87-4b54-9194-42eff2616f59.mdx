# Katalon Compact Utility for Katalon Studio


:::note

-   For Chrome: Katalon Studio version 8.2.5 onwards.
-   For Microsoft Edge: Katalon Studio version 8.3.5 onwards.
-   A Chrome or Microsoft Edge Profile. Find more information at Google Help Center: [Share Chrome with others](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824/share-chrome-with-others-computer), and Microsoft Support: [Sign in and create multiple profiles in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435).

:::

In restricted environments, unpacked extensions are disabled as a security feature. In that case, when you use the Spy, Record, and Smart Wait with Chrome, Katalon Studio might prompt this error message: "*Loading the unpacked extension is disabled by the administrators*."

Alternatively, you can use the Katalon Compact Utility \(KCU\) packed extension. The extension is available on Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons.

This article shows you how to install the KCU extension and configure your Profile to use the Spy, Record, and Smart Wait in Katalon Studio.


:::note

-   This utility is linked with your Chrome/ Microsoft Edge Profile, which means you can only have one active session at any given time. Make sure you log out of all your Chrome/ Microsoft Edge sessions before executing.
