# Machine Quota exceeded

1.  If the number of machines on which you're using Katalon Studio exceeds the number of licenses that you purchased, you have two options:

    -   Subscribe to more licenses to cover more machines and execution sessions. See [Upgrade Subscriptions](/administer/administration-tasks/subscription-management/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/upgrade-billing-plan-of-licenses).
    -   Remove the machines. See [Revoke and transfer a license](/administer/administration-tasks/license-management/manage-katalon-licenses).
