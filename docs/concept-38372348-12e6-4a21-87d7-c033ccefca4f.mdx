# Test runs reports overview

The test runs overview module provides you with an overview of execution trends. It also presents a profile coverage and shows you the platform coverage of test runs and test results.

This module highlights your testing activities with real-time data. The data is assembled into the following three components:

-   Profile coverage

-   Execution trend

-   Platform coverage


If these components drive insights and assist you in the decision-making process of a product cycle.

## Profile coverage

This section allows you to monitor:

-   The number of passed and failed test runs within a specific date range in each corresponding profile.
-   The number of passed, failed, error, and incomplete test results within a specific date range in each corresponding profile.
