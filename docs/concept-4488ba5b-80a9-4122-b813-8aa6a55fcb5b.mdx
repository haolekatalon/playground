You have successfully mapped test status between qTest and Katalon Studio.

## Manage test cases between qTest and Katalon Studio

After enabling qTest integration in Katalon Studio, you can perform interactions between qTest and Studio test cases.

To submit test results from Katalon Studio to qTest, you need to have your test cases populated in both qTest and Studio. You have three different ways to do this:

-   You have test cases in Studio but not in qTest, you can upload Studio test cases to qTest. You can do so with one or many test cases.

-   You have test cases in qTest but not in Studio, you can download qTest test cases to Studio.

-   You can have existing test cases in both qTest and Studio, you can map a Katalon test case to a qTest test case by database ID.


You can check which Katalon Studio test cases need updating when the integrated qTest test cases change the test step content and retrieve the latest content.

You can also disintegrate a qTest and Katalon Studio test case connection if you no longer need to submit test results from the test case.

### Upload Katalon Studio test cases to qTest

Katalon allows you to upload a test case or all test cases in a test case folder to qTest.

-   The test case or the test case folder you wish to upload must locate in the integrated test case folder with qTest. To learn more about integrating a test case folder with qTest, refer to step 4 in manual setup. See above: [Set up qTest integration manually](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/configure-qtest-integration-in-katalon-studio#).


1.  Upload a test case to qTest
2.  To upload a test case to qTest, in the **Tests Explorer** panel, right-click on the test case to trigger its context menu. Select **qTest** &gt; **Upload**.
