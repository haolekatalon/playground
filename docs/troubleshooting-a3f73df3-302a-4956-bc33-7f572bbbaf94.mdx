# Fail to start the Appium server in 60 seconds

When you encounter one of the following errors:

-   Fail to start the Appium server in 60 seconds.
-   Original error: 'x.x.SplashActivity' never started.

You can find the root cause by going to **Windows** &gt; **Katalon Studio Preferences** &gt; **Katalon** &gt; **Mobile**, then set your Appium Log Level to **Debug**.

After this change is applied, retry your record/spy session and then open generated .appium file in the project folder. Somewhere in this file you are likely will see these lines:

```
[debug] [ADB] Running '..\adb.exe' with args: [...] [debug] [ADB] Found package: 'com.abc.def.xyz' and fully qualified activity name : 'com.egh.jik' [debug] [ADB] Incorrect package and activity. Retrying.
```

This is because Katalon Studio can't start application due to incorrect package and activity by default, so you need to add additional settings to desired capabilities. Do as follows:

1.  Navigate to Mobile settings \(**Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Execution** &gt; **default** &gt; **Mobile** &gt; **Android**\).

2.  Add the following key:

    -   Name: appWaitActivity.

    -   Value: com.\* \(**based on the prefix of 'Found package' log**\).
