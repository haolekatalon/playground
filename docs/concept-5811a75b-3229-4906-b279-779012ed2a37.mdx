# \[WebUI\] Plan test suite

## Plan a test suite

Planning a test suite helps ensure you will not need to restructure test cases. By doing so, you reduce execution errors.

Ask yourself the following questions:

-   What is your test suite goal?
-   How do you want to execute your test suite?

## Define test suite goals

A test suite includes a series of actions depicting a particular user experience on your website.

You plan test cases based on deciding which action a test case should perform. You then create a test suite flow by naming and ordering test cases.

For example, to test the online shopping experience of users, your test suite might include actions as per the following sequence:

-   *Sign up* or *log in* test case.
-   *Enter shopping cart* test case.
-   *Check out* test case.
-   *Order confirmation* test case.

Structuring test cases in a test suite prevents chaos and identifies issues before test suite execution.

## Test suite execution

Once defining test suite goals, the following guidelines could support your test suite execution step by step:

1.  [Create a new test suite](/organize/manage-tests/test-suite/manage-test-suites-in-katalon-studio#).
2.  Plan test suite operation.

    -   [Modify execution information](/execute/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio/execute-dynamic-test-suites-in-katalon-studio#).
    -   [Manage test case list](/organize/manage-tests/test-suite/manage-test-suites-in-katalon-studio#).
3.  View [Test suite reports](/analyze/reports/view-test-reports/view-test-reports-in-katalon-studio/view-test-suite-and-test-suite-collection-reports-in-katalon-studio#).

    Katalon Studio logs test suite results in different formats and provides a complete account of the test suite process to help spot errors and reduce test case restructuring time.
