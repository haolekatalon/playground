# Toolbars and icons in Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\)

The following system features are added to perform Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) actions. These buttons and icons are placed on the navigation bar and multiple user interfaces for you to create, record, run, and publish Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test cases.

## Test Explorer view

The Test Explorer view is where you can find all of your test automation assets, including your test cases. When you click **Tests**, the <code>Draft Test Cases</code> folder, which contains all your draft test cases, is selected on the left. On the right, all of your draft test cases are displayed in a table format, along with information such as draft test case description, date created, and date the draft test case was last updated.

<table><tr><th>Icon</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody><tr><td><img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Cloud_Studio/Images/Katalon_Cloud_Recorder.png" width={100} /></td><td>Record new test case using default test website. You can delete and enter your preferred website address.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Cloud_Studio/Images/Create_new_blank_test_case.png" width={120} /></td><td>Create a new blank test case.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Editor view

Clicking a draft test case from <code>Test Explorer</code> view directs you to a preview of the selected draft test case, which displays the test case title, description \(which is editable\), and the **Edit Test Steps** button:

<table><tr><th>Icon</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody><tr><td><img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Cloud_Studio/Images/Edit_test_steps_button.png" width={130} /></td><td>Edit test steps; Opens up the <span>Katalon Editor</span></td></tr></tbody></table>

When you click the **Edit Test Steps** button, you are then directed to the Editor view, where you can view and edit your test steps, **Run** or execute draft test case using Test Browser or TestCloud, and **Publish** draft test case.

There is a visible **Add New Test Step** button for you to add a new test step. You can also use the contextual menu actions to perform inline actions. See: [Edit draft test case](/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio/create-and-manage-a-draft-test-case/edit-draft-test-case).

You can access the execution log of the latest test run of your draft test case by scrolling down to the **Log** section. See: [Run a draft test case](/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio/create-and-manage-a-draft-test-case/run-a-draft-test-case).

## Test browser view

The Test browser view displays the website based on the app URL provided in the test case. The test browser view also includes a floating **Special Actions** menu. The floating menu shows the newly recorded step in plain English and allows you to record [Supported Actions](/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio/create-and-manage-a-draft-test-case/supported-actions) as additional test steps to your draft test case. You can also use the **Special Actions** menu to stop recording.
