# Edit a published Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test case

Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) and later versions allows you to edit a published Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test case only.

After publishing a draft test case to a Git repository, you can now edit or modify your published Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test case to ensure that it remains accurate and up-to-date.


:::note

-   You can only edit published test cases created on Cloud Studio \(Beta\). Published Katalon Studio test cases can only be edited on Katalon Studio.


:::

1.  From the Project home screen, go to **Tests** &gt; **Test Cases** and select the published Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test case you wish to edit.

2.  Click **Edit Test Steps**. Cloud Studio \(Beta\) will create a new draft test case from the published test case.

3.  Edit the test steps.

4.  When you are satisfied with all the changes, click **Publish** and add a commit message.


Your published Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test case is now updated.
