# \[Mobile\] Android Setup in Katalon Studio

This article shows you how to set up real Android devices to test Android applications with Katalon Studio.


:::note

-   If you want to perform Android mobile testing with Android Studio \(Emulator\), you can refer to this document: [\[Mobile\] Configure Android Studio \(Emulator\)](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/mobile-testing/android/mobile-configure-android-studio-emulator-in-katalon-studio#).

## Set up Android tests on Windows, Linux and macOS

### On Windows machine

1.  Supported environments

    -   Appium: 1.12.1 onwards.

    -   Android: 6.x onwards \(official releases\).

2.  Download and install the suitable version of Node.js for your system from the Node.js website: [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

    
    :::note

    -   Make sure you install Node.js into a location where you have full Read/Write permissions.
    :::

3.  Install Appium version 1.12.1 or newer via NPM. To install the latest Appium version, copy and paste the command-line argument as follows: <code>npm install -g appium</code>

    
    :::note

    -   We recommend installing the latest Appium version.

    -   Some emulators support Appium directly when installed. If you want to run an application on an emulator, check your emulator settings before installing Appium.
    :::

    To learn more about Appium, you can refer to the Appium document here: [Getting started](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/#installing-appium).

4.  Set up the devices

    -   Turn on the phone's developer mode. Go to **Settings** &gt; **Developer options**, enable:

        -   USB debugging – Debug mode when USB is connected.
        -   Install via USB – Allow installing apps via USB.
        -   USB debugging \(Security Setting\) – Allow granting permissions and simulating input via USB debugging.
    -   Connect your Android phones to your computer via a USB cable.

    -   Confirm to accept or trust the device.

5.  Install Android SDK

    Katalon Studio will automatically detect and ask you to install **Android SDK** if your current machine does not have it.


### On macOS machine

1.  Supported environments

    -   Appium: 1.12.1 onwards.

    -   Android: 6.x onwards.

2.  Download and install the suitable version of Node.js for your system from the Node.js website: [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

    -   Some emulators support Appium directly when installed. If you want to run an application on an emulator, check your emulator settings before installing Appium.
    :::

    -   If you see an EACCES error with the Appium installation command, follow the instructions of npm documentation here: [Resolving EACCES permissions errors when installing packages globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).
    -   If you encounter an error where the Java <code>jar</code> file can't be found, you might need to add the environment variable: <code>KATALON&#95;JAVA&#95;HOME= &lt;JRE&#95;location&gt;</code>. See related discussion on Ask Ubuntu: [How to set JAVA\_HOME for Java?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/175514/how-to-set-java-home-for-java?utm_medim=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa)
    -   Set the Appium directory manually in **Katalon Studio Preferences**. The default directory should be <code>/usr/lib/node&#95;modules/appium/</code>.

4.  Set up the devices

    -   Turn on developer mode on your Android device. Go to **Settings** &gt; **Developer options**.

    -   Connect your Android device to your computer via a USB cable. Just confirm if prompted to accept or trust the device.

5.  Install Android SDK \(Optional\)

    Katalon Studio will automatically detect and ask you to install **Android SDK** if your current machine does not have it.


## Verify successful Android devices connection

After completing setting up your environment, to check whether Katalon successfully recognizes your Android devices, you can open a Mobile Testing Sample Project in **File &gt; New sample projects &gt; Sample Android Mobile Tests Project**.

<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/mobile-on-macos/KS-Android-Open--Sample-project.png" alt="Open Android sample project" />

On the main toolbar, select the **Android** device in the dropdown list next to **Run**.

<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/execute-mobile-testing-with-emulator/KS-TOOLBAR-Android.png" alt="Select Android devices" />

You should see the name of your Android device in the pop-up dialog.
