# Set desired capabilities for TestCloud environment

In your Katalon project, you can set desired capabilities for browsers and applications. When executing your test with **TestCloud** environment on TestOps, these desired capabilities will be applied.

Here are some common use cases that desired capabilities become useful for web and mobile testing:

-   [Chrome/Chrome \(headless\)](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/set-up-desired-capabilities-for-webui-testing-in-katalon-studio#): start Chrome maximized by default.

-   [Firefox/Firefox \(headless\)](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/set-up-desired-capabilities-for-webui-testing-in-katalon-studio#): start Firefox at a default page.

-   [Start browsers in private mode in Katalon Studio](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/start-browsers-in-private-mode-in-katalon-studio).

-   [Set up remote server in desired capabilities in Katalon Studio](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/set-up-remote-server-in-desired-capabilities-in-katalon-studio).

-   Using the <code>acceptInsecureCerts</code> capability to bypass, or implicitly trust, TLS certificates that the certificate service in the browser does not trust.

-   Using the <code>autoGrantPermissions</code> to automatically determine which permissions your app requires and grant them to the app.

-   Using the <code>autoAcceptAlerts</code> to automatically accept all alerts if they pop up.

-   Set landscape orientation.


This document shows you how to set desired capabilities when executing tests on TestOps with **TestCloud** environment. If this is your first time executing tests with **TestCloud** environments on TestOps, refer to this documentation beforehand: [Schedule test runs on TestOps with TestCloud environment](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testcloud/use-testcloud-in-testops#).

## Set desired capabilities for TestCloud environments

This section shows you how to set desired capabilities for **TestCloud** environments.

1.  In Katalon Studio, open your Katalon project.

    1.  For desktop browsers on Windows/ Linux: Go to **Project Settings** &gt; **Desired Capabilities** &gt; **WebUI** and select a browser type, for example Chrome.

    2.  For desktop browsers on macOS, mobile browsers, and mobile native applications: Go to **Project Settings** &gt; **Desired Capabilities** &gt; **Remote**.

2.  Input the desired capabilities. Learn more about desired capabilities in Katalon Studio here: [Introduction to Desired Capabilities in Katalon Studio](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/introduction-to-desired-capabilities-in-katalon-studio).

3.  Save your configurations.

4.  Open and execute your project with **TestCloud** environment on Katalon TestOps.


Your tests are executed with the desired capabilities that you configured in Katalon Studio.
