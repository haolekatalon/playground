# Execute tests with Katalon Studio overview

This section shows you how to execute tests in Katalon Studio.

You can execute a test case, test suite, dynamic test suite, and test suite collection in Katalon Studio. For test suite collections, you can choose to execute associated test suites in sequential mode or in parallel mode.

## Test Environments

Below is the list of supported test execution environments in Katalon Studio:

-   **Browsers**:

    -   Chrome

    -   Firefox

    -   Safari

    -   Edge Chromium

    -   IE \(for Windows only\)

-   **TestCloud**: Cloud-based environment in Katalon Platform. This option is available for executing test suite and test suite collection. See [Katalon TestCloud overview](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testcloud/testcloud-overview).

-   **Headless browsers**: Testing the functionality of a Web page without the presence of a GUI:
