# Configure Proxy Authentication

If you are behind a proxy server, before activating Katalon licenses, you need to configure the Authentication proxy settings. This guide will allow you to authenticate and activate your Katalon licenses while working behind a proxy server.

To learn more about how to activate Katalon licenses, see [Activate Katalon License](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/activate-a-katalon-license).

## Configure proxy

1.  Open Katalon Studio. In the toolbar, click on the *Profile* button and select **Log out**. You will be logged out of your current account, and the **Katalon Studio Activation** dialog appears.

    :::note

    -   If you download Katalon Studio for the first time or are not logged in to any account in Katalon Studio, when you open Katalon Studio, the **Katalon Studio Activation** automatically pops up.

    :::

2.  Click **Configure Authentication Proxy** at the bottom of the Activation dialog box.

    In the Proxy Settings dialog box, you can select one of the three options below.

    -   **Use system proxy configuration**: Katalon Studio automatically syncs with the proxy server behind your system.
    -   **No proxy**: There's no proxy.
    -   **Manual proxy configuration**: You can manually set up your proxy.

If you are in a highly secured environment, you might encounter a situation where you fail to execute test scripts or activate Katalon Studio. To fix this problem, you need to whitelist the domains listed in this document: [Network security errors](/administer/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-activation-problem/network-security-errors).
