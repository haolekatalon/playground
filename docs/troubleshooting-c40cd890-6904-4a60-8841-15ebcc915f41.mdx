# New and old proxy mechanisms are not allowed in one command

When you encounter the following error while executing with KRE in console mode:

```
New and old proxy mechanisms are not allowed in one command. Please use either the new or the old one.
```

1.  Check if you are mixing options of the new mechanism with options for proxy configuration prior to 7.5.0 and correct the commands in use. Learn more at [Proxy options](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/command-line-syntax-in-katalon-runtime-engine#).
