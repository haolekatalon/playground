# Trial and Free Plans

## Trial License

Users registering with a valid email are eligible for a **30-day** trial of both **Katalon Studio Enterprise** \(KSE\) per-User and **Katalon Runtime Engine** \(KRE\) floating licenses.


:::note

-   The trial licenses for Katalon Studio Enterprise and Katalon Runtime Engine are automatically generated and activated when you first log into the Katalon Studio application.

:::

Once successfully verified and activated, these are what all new Katalon accounts will have access to:

Katalon Platform

-   3,500 Monthly Test Results
-   5 Platform Users
-   5 Active Projects

Katalon Platform Licenses

-   1 Katalon Studio Enterprise
-   1 Katalon Runtime Engine
-   5 TestCloud sessions/parallel tests
-   1,000 visual testing checkpoint images/month

Katalon Standalone

-   1 Katalon Studio Enterprise
-   1 Katalon Runtime Engine

Each trial license can be activated on only one machine at a time.

You can start using KSE and KRE for 30 days. When your trial period expires, you need to purchase licenses to continue using KSE and KRE, or you can use the Katalon Studio free license with basic testing features.


:::note

-   For **Offline licenses**, you cannot remove a machine ID registered for the trial licenses once it has been activated.

## Free License

The free license offers core features of the low-code test automation experience in Katalon Studio. You can see a breakdown of features available to free users here: [Katalon Studio vs Katalon Studio Enterprise Features](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/katalon-studio-vs-katalon-studio-enterprise-features).

Katalon Free comes with:

If you've used up your test results or any of the above, you'll have to upgrade to paid options.

Currently, the free license does not include Katalon Runtime Engine and console mode features.

You can upgrade Katalon Studio to Katalon Studio Enterprise at any time without re-download.
