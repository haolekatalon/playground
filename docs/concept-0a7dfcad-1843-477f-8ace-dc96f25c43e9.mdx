# Manage BDD test cases with Jira integration

This article shows you how to configure Katalon BDD custom fields in Jira.

## Requirements

-   Enable Jira integration with Katalon TestOps. To enable Jira integration with Katalon TestOps, follow the steps in this document: [TestOps - Jira Integration](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/jira-integration/enable-testops-jira-integration-for-test-management#).

To create Katalon BDD fields in Jira, follow theses steps:

1.  From Jira settings, select **Issues**. In the **Fields** section, select **Custom fields** &gt; **Create custom field**.

2.  Depending on your Jira products: Jira Cloud or Jira Data Center \(Jira Server\), you need to write your BDD scenarios in different field type:

    -   For Jira Data Center \(Jira Server\): Select **Katalon Gherkin**.

    -   For Jira Cloud: Select **Paragraph \(supports rich text\)**.

    This custom field lets you write descriptions for your test cases and stories in Gherkin syntax. Gherkin keywords such as <code>Given</code>, <code>When</code>, <code>Then</code> will be highlighted automatically.

3.  Click **Next**.

4.  In the new window, provide a name and a description \(optional\). Then click **Create**.

5.  Choose which screens to display and select **Update** to finish adding your new custom field.
