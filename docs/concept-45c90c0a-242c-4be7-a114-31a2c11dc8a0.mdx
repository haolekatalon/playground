# Handle conditional cases in your tests with Katalon Recorder

Katalon Recorder supports the following flow control methods:

-   Branching

-   Loops


## Branching

Conditional branching allows your test to behave differently based on certain conditions.

### if

The <code>if</code> command opens a conditional branch. The target of an <code>if</code> command is an expression that evaluates to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The expression can be a JavaScript expression with variables. If the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>, all the steps following <code>if</code> will be executed until a <code>else if</code>, <code>else</code> or <code>endif</code> command is found.

### else if

The <code>elseif</code> command is similar to the <code>if</code> command. If the steps between <code>if</code> and <code>elseif</code> are not executed, the expression in <code>elseif</code> will be evaluated. If the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>, all commands following <code>elseif</code> will be executed until a <code>else if</code>, <code>else</code>, or <code>endif</code> command is found.

### else

The <code>else</code> command usually follows the <code>if</code> command. If the steps between <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> are not executed, the steps following <code>else</code> will be executed until a <code>endif</code> command is found.

### endif

The <code>endif</code> command terminates the conditional branching block. You need to add <code>endif</code> to your test, otherwise you will get an error message.

## Looping

Looping allows you to repeat steps until a condition is met.

### while

The <code>while</code> command starts a loop. The target of a <code>while</code> command is an expression that evaluates to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The expression can be a JavaScript with variables. If the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>, the steps following <code>while</code> will be executed until <code>endwhile</code> is found and the expression evaluates again. The steps between <code>while</code> and <code>endwhile</code> will be executed repeatedly until the expression evaluates to <code>false</code>.

### endWhile

The <code>endwhile</code> command terminates the looping branching block. You need to add <code>endwhile</code> to your test, otherwise you will get an error message.

## Sample Projects

Katalon Recorder comes with some sample projects \(templates\) to help you get started with flow controls.

1.  In Katalon Recorder, go to Templates.

2.  Choose *Conditional and loops* from the left-side bar.

3.  Check the sample projects.

4.  Click on the **Add Templates**


You should see the sample projects are added to your workspace.
