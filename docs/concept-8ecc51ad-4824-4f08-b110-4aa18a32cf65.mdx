:::note

-   Please note that the use case presented here is a suggestion only and should be implemented with caution. It has not undergone quality assurance testing and is not officially supported by our platform.

This article guidelines how Katalon Studio helps users to automate Power BI applications. We will present two PowerBI applications: Power Apps portal and PowerBI with sample test cases in our [GitHub sample repository](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/katalon-powewbi-sample.git).

## How to automate PowerBI applications

The test cases for automation:

-   Test case with Power Apps portal: Login into the power app portal and Create a flagging Request.

-   Test case with PowerBI: Create a Dashboard, create content and delete dashboard


1.  In Katalon Studio, go to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Test Design** &gt; **WebUI** and change the priority of Xpath Locators.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/PowerBI_integration/images/KS-_change_priority_of_xpath_locators.png" alt="change priority of Xpath locators" />

2.  Record test script via Katalon Recorder and save test objects and test cases. You can refer to [Record web utility in Katalon Studio](/create-tests/record-and-spy/webui-record-and-spy-utilities/record-web-utility-in-katalon-studio).

    You can also use the test in our sample project, by updating the application URL, Username, and Password inside the Default Profile. Refer to [Execution profile](/create-tests/data-driven-testing/execution-profile).<img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/PowerBI_integration/images/KS-run_powerBI_sample_test.png" alt="run PowerBI sample test" />

3.  Run the test execution. You can refer to [Execute tests with Katalon Studio overview](/execute/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio-overview).

4.  Verify the test execution result. You can refer to [View test results and execution logs in Katalon TestOps](/analyze/reports/view-test-reports/view-test-reports-in-katalon-testops/view-test-run-results/view-test-results-and-execution-logs-in-katalon-testops/view-test-results-and-execution-logs-in-katalon-testops).
