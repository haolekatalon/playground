# Create test case with Record and Playback in Katalon Studio

Test recording is the easiest way for new automation testers to start learning test automation. Identifying objects on applications is time-consuming. The [Web Recorder Utility](/create-tests/record-and-spy/webui-record-and-spy-utilities/record-web-utility-in-katalon-studio) function captures your actions being performed on the application and converts them into runnable code in the back-end.

You can quickly automate a few functionalities of your app and save time by recording actions that have to be performed many times in iterative builds. This function supports recording and running the same tests on multiple browsers. This document shows you how to:

## Rename Page Folders and Elements while Recording

To organize your test scripts in page object pattern, you need to add test objects in the folder corresponding to the page. This action helps you reuse and maintain the objects.

**Scenario:** Login with valid data

1.  Launch the application under test \(Example: [http://demoaut.katalon.com/](http://demoaut.katalon.com/)\)
2.  Click the **Make Appointment** button
3.  Enter a valid username, password, and click **Login**

**Step 1:** Launch Katalon Studio and go to **File** &gt; **New** &gt; **Test Case** on the main toolbar. Provide a name for your test case and click **OK**. An empty test case is created.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks-840-change-element-name.png" width={500} alt="Change element name in your test case." />

**Step 2:** Click **Record Web** on the main toolbar.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks-840-record-web.png" width={300} alt="The record web toolbar in Katalon Studio." />

**Step 3:** The **Record** dialog displays. Select a browser and click the **Record** button to start recording the test case.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks-855-select-browser.png" width={700} alt="Select the browser you want to record in using the Web Recorder in Katalon Studio." />

**Step 4:** Once your application has been launched, click on the **Make Appointment** button. You are directed to the **Login** page.

**Step 5:**Navigate back to the **Web Recorder** window. Click **expand.**

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks-expand-button-web-recorder.png" alt="Expand the Web Recorder menu in Katalon Studio." />

By default, this will expand the menu downwards and show all recorded actions.

**Step 6:**Click on **Show Captured Objects**. This will expand the **Web Recorder** window again, this time to the right.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks_recorder_expanded_1.png" alt="Click on Show Captured Objects to expand the Web Recorder window." />

If you cannot see the expanded window, drag the **Web Recorder** window to the left until all elements are visible. It should look as below:

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks_recorder_expanded_2.png" alt="The full Web Recorder window in Katalon Studio." />

**Step 7:**Go to the **Captured Objects** window and click on "Page\_CURA Healthcare Service". This will unfurl the toggle menu. It will go to "a\_Make Appointment" by default.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks-selection-method.png" width={500} alt="Go to the Captured Objects window and unfurl the page." />

**Step 8:** Rename the page name from "Page\_CURA Healthcare Service" to "Page\_Home Page."

**Step 9:** In the **Captured Objects** frame, select the **a\_Make Appointment** element.

**Step 10:** Rename the element name from "a\_Make Appointment" to "button\_Make Appointment."

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks-840-captured-objects.png" width={500} alt="Rename the a_Make Appointment button." />

**Step 11:** Go back to the recording browser and continue to record. Click **Login**.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks-login.png" width={500} alt="Record logging in to the test website." />

**Step 12:** Repeat the same steps above to change the name of the object **Login** and its folder.

**Step 13:** You can stop recording by clicking **Stop**. Click **OK** to save recorded actions into Katalon Studio.

**Step 14:** You are prompted to save the captured objects to **Object Repository****,** which can be reused whenever needed. You can also create a folder to maintain page objects in your desired structure. Click **OK** to continue.

**Step 15:** Recorded objects and actions are saved in the test case as shown below.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Record_And_Spy/WebUI_Record_And_Spy_Utilities/create_test_case_using_record_playback/image/ks-840-test-case.png" width={600} alt="Recorded objects and actions are saved in the test case as shown below." />

Click **Run** to execute the recorded test cases in your desired browser.

**Source Code:**

```
import static com.kms.katalon.core.testobject.ObjectRepository.findTestObject
import com.kms.katalon.core.webui.keyword.WebUiBuiltInKeywords as WebUI
 
WebUI.openBrowser('')
 
WebUI.navigateToUrl('http://demoaut.katalon.com/')
 
WebUI.click(findTestObject('Page_Home Page/button_Make Appointment'))
 
WebUI.click(findTestObject('Page_Login/button_Login'))
 
WebUI.closeBrowser()


```

Thus we can record the actions being performed using Katalon Studio. However, there are a few actions which cannot be recorded.

### What cannot be recorded?

Though recording your tests saves time, we cannot validate some scenarios such as Web Table handling, switching to multiple frames, switching to windows, handling captcha, image recognition, and video playbacks.
