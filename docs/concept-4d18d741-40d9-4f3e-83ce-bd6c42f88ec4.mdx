# Load Balancing for Local Test Environments

With Katalon TestOps, your tests can be executed in parallel using load-balanced configurations.

To do so, Katalon TestOps distributes Test Executions over Agents to optimize Remote Execution efficiency.

Each Agent can be configured with a unique Threshold. Test Executions can then be setup to minimize Agent idleness.


:::note

-   You have at least one active Local Test Environment. See: [Create a Local Test Environment with an Agent](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/create-a-local-test-environment-with-an-agent).


:::

## Configure an Agent's Threshold

An Agent's Threshold is the maximum number of sessions that an Agent can execute concurrently in a Local Test Environment.

You must configure the Threshold value to assign the number of jobs to an Agent.


:::note

-   By default, the Threshold value of all Agents is set as **1**.


:::

To configure an Agent's Threshold, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your Project.

2.  Go to **Configurations** &gt; **Test Environments**.

    The **Test Environments** page appears.

3.  Click on the Local Test Environment you want to configure the Agent's Threshold for.

    The **Agent Details** page appears as below.

4.  Update the value in the **Threshold** section.

5.  Click **Update**.


The maximum number of concurrent sessions that an Agent can execute is equal to the Threshold value you have configured.

You can check the sessions in the **Test Environments** page.

## Assign an Agent to execute Test Runs

### For a new Test Plan

You can create a new Test Runs Schedule to assign an Agent for Test Executions. See: [Schedule Test Runs](/execute/schedule-test-execution/schedule-test-runs-in-testops).

When creating a new Test Runs Schedule, you are asked to select Test Environments. You can select an Agent here to assign it to your new Test Plan.

### For an existing Test Plan

1.  Go to your Project &gt; **Test Execution** &gt; **Test Run List**.

2.  Click on a Test Run List.

3.  Click **Edit**.

    The **Schedule Test Run** dialog appears as below.

4.  Go to the **Test Environments** section, select a new Agent.

5.  Click **Save**.



:::tip

-   You can reassign an old Test Run List or assign multiple new Test Run Lists to any configured Agent.
