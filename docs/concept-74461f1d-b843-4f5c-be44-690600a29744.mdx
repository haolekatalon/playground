## View Re-run Test Results

If you execute a Test Run multiple times, you can view the Re-run Test Results in that Test Run's summary and details.

Follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login), then go to your Project.
2.  Go to **Reports** &gt; **Test Runs**.
3.  Click on the Test Run ID you want to view.
4.  Select the **Test Results** tab.

You can find the final status of a Test Run and its latest result here.

A re-run result has the *Re-run \#* label next to its name, with *\#* represents the re-run number.
