# Manually push Katalon test result to Xray

-   You must have the role of Organization Owner or Admin.

-   You have linked your Jira test cases to the Jira test plan.

-   You have linked a Katalon test run to an Xray test plan.


If you have opted for **Manual push only** mechanism to upload Katalon test result to Jira/Xray, Katalon will not automatically upload all test results to Jira/Xray. You will decide which test run result to be uploaded to Jira/Xray. This article will show you how to do that. You can also refer to this [video](https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/c0VtfQVxX6q) for demonstration.

1.  After your test run has finished. Navigate to the test run page: **Reports** &gt; **Test Runs** &gt; **Test Runs**.

    The Test Ops Test Runs page appears as below. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Integration_For_Organizing_Tests/Xray_Integration/Manually_push_test_result_to_Xray/image/TO-Reports-Test_Runs-Test_Runs.png" alt="Test Ops Test Runs list" />

2.  Select a test run by clicking on its **ID** number.

3.  From the test run detail page, select **Push to Xray**.

4.  Type in the **Xray Test Plan** and select one from the suggesting dropdown list.

5.  Choose a release version for your test run if necessary: in the **Release Version** section, choose from the dropdown list a release version.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Integration_For_Organizing_Tests/Xray_Integration/Manually_push_test_result_to_Xray/image/TO-Reports-Xray_push_-_release_version.png" width={700} alt="Choose test run release version to push to Xray" />

6.  Click **Submit** to upload the test result to Xray.


An Xray test execution issue is created on Jira bearing the Katalon test execution ID in its designated name. In the Xray test execution issue below, the name **Test execution 27** indicates the TestOps test run ID was 27. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Integration_For_Organizing_Tests/Xray_Integration/Link_a_Katalon_test_case_with_an_Xray_test/images/Xray_test_execution_issue.png" alt="Xray test execution issue" />
