# How Katalon generates a machine ID

A Machine ID generated by Katalon is based on the hardware specifications and the user account logged into that machine at the time.

For example:

User A logs into machine A and it has machine ID X. User B logs into machine A and it has machine ID Y. In this case, there are 2 licenses needed: one for each user.

## View your machine ID with Katalon Runtime Engine

You can inspect the machine ID assigned to your machine by running a test in Katalon Runtime Engine \(KRE\).

View your machine ID by following these steps:

1.  Run a test with KRE. Learn how to do so here: [Execute tests with KRE](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/get-started-with-katalon-runtime-engine#).

2.  KRE automatically fetches your machine ID to validate your license. You can view your machine ID information in the terminal:
