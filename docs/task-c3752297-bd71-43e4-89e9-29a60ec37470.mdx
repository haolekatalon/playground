# Use client certificate for requests in API projects in Katalon Studio

-   You need an active Katalon Studio Enterprise license.

-   This setting is only applied for requests in API/Web Services projects.


Katalon Studio can be configured to use the client certificate for all requests. You can configure the client certificate by navigating to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Network** &gt; **Client certificate settings**. To sign all the requests from Katalon Studio, you need to specify the full path to your **KeyStore** file and the **KeyStore Password**. The recommended key store format is **PKCS \#12** \(.p12\).

To generate public and private key pairs \(KeyStore and KeyStore Password\) for the above configuration, you can use the *keytool* utility that is included in the JDK installation. Do as follows:

1.  Open the command prompt and navigate to the bin folder in the JDK folder.

2.  Run this command to create a **KeyStore**:

    ```
    keytool -genkey -alias katalon -keyalg RSA -keystore katalon.keystore
    ```

3.  Enter a password for the new **KeyStore** and provide the utility with the required information: your name, the name of your organization, etc.

4.  To export a certificate with your public key, run this command:

    ```
    keytool -export -alias katalon -file katalon.cer -keystore katalon.keystore
    ```
