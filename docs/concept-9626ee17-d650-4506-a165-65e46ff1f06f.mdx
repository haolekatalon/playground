# Assert Statements

An assert statement contains a boolean expression where this condition must hold true for the test execution to continue. Thus, execution of the assertion causes evaluation of the boolean expression, and an error is reported if the expression evaluates as false.


:::note

-   Once a test step is added as any of the control statements, it is not allowed to change into another keyword.

2.  To add a keyword under a statement, select that statement, then click **Add** . A test step is created under that statement.

## In script view

The **Script** view of test cases allows you to programmatically define and handle assertions using either Groovy or Java language. For more details regarding assertions in Groovy, refer to this Groovy documentation: [Core Testing Guide.html](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/latest/html/documentation/core-testing-guide.html).

For example:

```
WebUiBuiltInKeywords.openBrowser('', FailureHandling.STOP_ON_FAILURE)
WebUiBuiltInKeywords.navigateToUrl(GlobalVariable.global_Gmail_Url, FailureHandling.STOP_ON_FAILURE)
assert varA == true    
            
```
