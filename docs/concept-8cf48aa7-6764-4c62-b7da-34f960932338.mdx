# Execute a test case

You can run a single test case in Katalon Studio. This guide shows you how to perform test case execution in Katalon Studio. Before executing tests, see [Supported environments for Katalon Studio and Katalon Runtime Engine \(KRE\)](/supported-execution-environments/supported-environments-for-katalon-studio-and-katalon-runtime-engine-kre).

## Execute a test case

To execute a test case, follow these steps:

1.  In **Tests Explorer**, open a test case.

2.  Click on the drop-down of **Run** and select an environment to execute the test case.

    If you only click on **Run**, Katalon Studio executes the test case with the default execution environment defined in **Project Settings** &gt; **Execution** &gt; **Default execution**. See [Set desired execution behaviors of Katalon Studio](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/set-desired-execution-behaviors-of-katalon-studio).

3.  Click **Run**.


The **Job Progress** is triggered automatically to show the progress while your test suite is being executed.
