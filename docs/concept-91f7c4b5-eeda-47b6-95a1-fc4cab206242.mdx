# Execute test suite collections in Katalon Studio

This guide shows you how to configure, perform, and schedule your test suite collections in Katalon Studio.

You can execute a test suite collection in sequential or parallel mode. The behaviors of these two modes are described as follows.

## Sequential mode

The sequential mode allows you to execute the test suites one after another.

## Parallel mode

The parallel mode allows you to execute multiple test suites at the same time. With the parallel mode, you can set:

-   **Max concurrent instances**: The maximum number of test suites executing at the same time.

-   **Delay between instances \(in seconds\)**: The delay time between each test suite execution from 0-999 seconds. \(available from version 8.2.0\).


This function reduces the risk of CPU spike issues when there are too many concurrent instances. When a test suite is ready to start, Katalon Studio prints the following message in the **Event Log** tab:

```
Test suite ${testSuiteID} is ready to start at ${currentTimeStamp}
```

## Execute a test suite collection

To execute a test suite collection, follow these steps:

1.  In a test suite collection, click **Execution Information**.

2.  Select **Sequential** or **Parallel** mode.

    If you choose **Parallel** mode, you need to set the **Max concurrent instances** and the delay time between instances.

3.  For each test suite, click on **Run with** to select execution environments.

    If you choose **TestCloud** or **Mobile**, you need to click on **Run Configuration** for further set up.

4.  Choose a profile to run your test suite.

5.  In the **Run** column, you can select which test suites to be run in this execution.

6.  Once you are done, save your test suite collection and click **Execute**.

The **Job Progress** is triggered automatically to show the progress while your test suite collection is being executed.
