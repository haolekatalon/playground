# Failed Test Results

When a test failure occurs, it is associated with a failure reason. To help you monitor the quality of a Project via test failures, TestOps comes with a **Failed Test Results** chart that organizes test failures by reason type.


:::caution

-   **Failed Test Results** is limited to the Premium and Ultimate plans of Katalon Platform. See [Katalon Platform Plans](/administer/katalon-platform-packages/katalon-platform-plans) for more information.

## View failed test results

To view the Failed Test Results module:

1.  Log in to TestOps.

2.  Go to **Reports** &gt; **Test Runs** &gt; **Failed Test Results**.

3.  The **Failed Test Results** chart is displayed:

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/Failed_Test_Results/Image/TO-Reports-Failed_Test_Results.png" alt="Failed test results" />

    You can modify the **Failed Test Results** chart by using the following data filters in the drop-down:

    -   **All Results**: Shows statistics of all failed test results.

    -   **Latest Results**: Only shows statistics of the latest test result \(if the latest one failed\).

    Refer to the table below for the types of failure reasons and examples:

    <table><tr><th>Failure reasons</th><th>Examples</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Automation Bug</td><td><ul><li>Test script cannot be compiled (syntax errors) or executed with runtime errors.</li><li><p>Test script cannot locate web elements.</p></li><li><p>Insufficient wait time for test objects to load.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Application Bug</td><td><ul><li><p>Application logic has changed.</p></li><li><p>Unexpected behaviours of web elements.</p></li><li><p>Web elements no longer exist.</p></li><li><p>Use of new /unresolved libraries.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Network Issues/ Third Parties Issues</td><td><ul><li>Network connection is down.</li><li><p>Authentication issues.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Uncategorized</td><td>For other unspecified failure reasons.</td></tr>    </tbody></table>

4.  Scroll down and navigate to the **Top 10 Exceptions from all Test Results** section to view the ten \(10\) most common exceptions from failed test results. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/Failed_Test_Results/Image/TO-Reports-Top_10_exceptions.png" alt="top 10 exceptions from all test results" />
