# Upgrade your On-Premises License Server to v2.1.0

Here's a guide to upgrading to the newest version of your Katalon On-Premises License server.

## Upgrade an On-Premises License Server to v2.1.0 with the Katalon Platform \(SSL\)

This serves as a guide for users who want to upgrade their Katalon On-Premises solution \(with the Katalon Platform\) to the latest version.


:::note

-   You must have a working On-Premises package.

-   It's best for you to back up your database before performing this step to mitigate possible data loss.


:::

1.  Start by turning Docker off by running the following command:

    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

2.  Download the migration file from this url: [download link](https://katalon-one-build.s3.amazonaws.com/op/latest/migration.tar.gz).

3.  Load the migration file into docker by running the following command:

    ```
    docker load -i migration.tar.gz
    ```

4.  Run the migration file by inputting the following command:

    ```
    docker run --rm -ti -e "DB_HOST=<hostname/address>" -e "DB_PORT=5432" -e "DB_USERNAME=<DB username>" -e "DB_PASSWORD=<password>" migration:latest
    ```

5.  Create a folder for TestOps storage by running the command:

    ```
    mkdir /opt/testops_data 
    chmode 755 /opt/testops_data
    ```

6.  Reconfigure the .env file. It should contain the following:

    ```
    ### Katalon-OP env
    
    DB_HOST=<database_hostname>
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_USERNAME=postgres
    DB_PASSWORD=<database_password>
    
    # License Server configs
    ADMIN_EMAIL=<email>
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>
    LICENSE_SERVER_URL=https://admin.kata-op.com
    
    # TestOps configs (ignored without testops profile)
    TESTOPS_FILE_STORAGE_PATH=/opt/testops-data
    TESTOPS_SERVER_URL=https://testops.kata-op.com
    
    # HTTPS config
    HTTPS_PORT=443
    CERT_PATH=./katalon-op.crt
    KEY_PATH=./katalon-op.key
    KEY_PASSPHRASE=
    
    ```

7.  Install the v2.1.0 build by running the command:

    ```
    docker-compose --profile testops up -d
    ```


The upgrade is complete.
