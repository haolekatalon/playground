# Windows Record Utility in Katalon Studio

Katalon Studio provides the Windows record utility that allows you to record and playback actions performed in a Windows desktop application. With this utility, you can quickly create a test case, and later manually enhance the test.

This article introduces you to the components of the Windows record utility in Katalon Studio.

## Requirements

-   Katalon Studio version 7.0 onwards.
-   WinAppDriver is running on the test machine. To learn how to set up and run WinAppDriver, see: [Set up WinAppDriver](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/windows-desktop-apps-testing/set-up-winappdriver-in-katalon-studio).

## The Windows record utility

To open the utility, from the main toolbar, click on **Record Windows Action**.

The **Windows Action Recorder** dialog is displayed as below:

### Configurations

In the **CONFIGURATIONS** section, you can specify:

-   **Configuration**: the WinAppDriver URL and desired capabilities.

-   **Application File**: the absolute path to the Windows executable file \(\*.exe\) of the testing machine. For Windows users, click on the **Browse...** button to locate the application file.


### Recorded actions

After you interact with the application under test \(AUT\) using the built-in actions, the recorded actions are displayed in the **Recorded Actions** tab.

### Captured objects

During a recording session, the captured Windows objects are displayed in the **Captured Objects** tab. You can view and edit the object name, locator and properties.

You can modify the locator of an object in **Object Properties** and click **Highlight** to verify if the new locator correctly identifies the associated object.

### Screen View

The **Screen View** shows the application screenshots taken when you press the **Start** button to record or the **Refresh Screen** button to recapture the application images. The size of a captured screenshot is the same as the displayed application window on the testing machine.

### Screen Objects

The **Screen Objects** section shows a tree of all Windows objects you can interact with. To update this tree view, you can press the **Refresh Screen** button.

The selected object is highlighted with a green border on the **Screen View**.

### Possible Actions

The **Possible Actions** provides the built-in Windows actions that you can use to interact with the AUT.

<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/windows-record-utility/KS-Possible-Actions-section.png" alt="Possible actions" />

There are two types of Windows actions:

-   Object action: an action that you can perform on a specific Windows object. This type of action requires you to first select the target object on the **Screen Objects**, e.g., performing the *Click* action on a menu item.

-   Application action: an action for interacting with the application, e.g., the *Close Application* action.


## Export Option

When you finish the recording session, there are three options to export the recorded actions to a test case:

-   Export to new test case \(selected by default\).
-   Append to test case.
-   Overwrite test case.
