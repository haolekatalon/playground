# Use TestCloud in TestOps

Katalon TestCloud is available for seamless integration with Katalon TestOps.

Current test environments require time and effort to set up and maintain while providing limited browser/operating system \(OS\) options. By contrast, with a few clicks, you can set up a TestCloud Test Environment in **TestOps** for your test execution across browsers and OS.

The TestCloud Test Environment also allows you to:

-   Execute tests on a public domain.
-   Execute tests on a private domain via a TestCloud tunnel.
-   Track your TestCloud testing quota.

**TestCloud** stabilizes the test results when you execute a massive number of parallel tests.

## Requirements

-   An active Katalon TestCloud subscription or trial. See [TestCloud Trial](/administer/katalon-platform-packages/testcloud-feature-comparison#).

-   Kobiton integration must be disabled. You can toggle **Kobiton** off in advanced settings. See [Advanced settings](/execute/schedule-test-execution/schedule-test-runs-in-testops#).

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your Project.

3.  Give your test run a name, then select the Script repository that stores your project.

4.  Choose a test suite or test suite collection to execute.

5.  In the **Environment** section, click the drop-down menu and select **More options**.

6.  In **TestCloud** section, select your preferred environment\(s\) to run your test.

7.  Optional: You can toggle **Use TestCloud tunnel** to enable TestCloud tunnel. This option requires tunnel setup. For more details, see [Configure TestCloud Tunnel](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testcloud/schedule-test-runs-with-testcloud-tunnel#).
