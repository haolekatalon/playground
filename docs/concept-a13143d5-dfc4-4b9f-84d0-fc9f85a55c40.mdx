## Part 5: Distribute your app for testing on registered devices

To distribute your app for testing on registered devices, you need to archive and export an <code>.ipa</code> file. Do as follows:

### Prepare your app for distribution

1.  Open the project file with Xcode. For example, to open <code>Coffee Timer.xcodeproj</code>, from where you store the project &gt; **App** &gt; **Your-First-iOS-App** &gt; **Coffee Timer**. Double-click the <code>Coffee Timer.xcodeproj</code> file.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Set_Up_Projects/Mobile-Testing/iOS/Mobile_iOS_Setup_Real_Device/Pictures/open-xcode-file.png" alt="Open Xcode project" />

2.  After opening the project in Xcode, select a registered iOS device to launch the apps.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Set_Up_Projects/Mobile-Testing/iOS/Mobile_iOS_Setup_Real_Device/Pictures/select-device.png" width={300} alt="Select device" />

3.  In the **General** tab, set deployment iOS version and select device type in the **Deployment Info** section.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Set_Up_Projects/Mobile-Testing/iOS/Mobile_iOS_Setup_Real_Device/Pictures/deployment.png" width={500} alt="Choose deployment info" />

4.  Switch to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab, check the **Automatically manage signing** box, then choose the team that has your device registered in the Apple Developer Portal.

    By choosing the **Automatically manage signing** box, Xcode manages code signing assets for you. To learn more about automatic signing, you can refer to this Apple document: [Automatic signing](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev80cc24546).

5.  To build the <code>.ipa</code> file, click **Product &gt; Build**.


### Create an archive of your app

1.  To archive the <code>.ipa</code> file, click **Product &gt; Archive**. If the archive builds successfully, it appears in the Archives organizer.

    
    :::note

    -   You can't create an archive if you set the run destination to a simulator.
    :::


### Export your app using an ad hoc or development provisioning profile

When you export the app, Xcode re-signs the app using the code signing assets that you choose. To learn more about the distribution method, you can refer to this Apple document:[Distribution method.](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev31de635e5)

1.  To open the Archives organizer, choose **Window** &gt; **Organizer** and click **Archives**.

2.  Select the archive you want to export, then click **Distribute App** and follow the instructions to get the <code>.ipa</code> file. Here, we choose a development provisioning profile to export the <code>Coffee Timer.ipa</code> file.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Set_Up_Projects/Mobile-Testing/iOS/Mobile_iOS_Setup_Real_Device/Pictures/export.gif" alt="Distribute .ipa app" />


### Install the app on user devices

To verify the <code>.ipa</code> file, follow these steps:

1.  Open Xcode, then navigate to **Window &gt; Devices and Simulators**.

2.  Choose your device from the **Devices** list.

3.  Click *Add* \(+\) to browse the <code>.ipa</code> file.
