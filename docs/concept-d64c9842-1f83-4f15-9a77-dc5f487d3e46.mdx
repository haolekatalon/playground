    Two things happen when you click the **Record** button:

    -   Katalon Recorder auto-launches a new Chrome browser to the app URL you provided along with a Recorder **Select Actions** menu.

3.  Interact with the test browser so that your actions are recorded by Katalon Recorder. You can also use the floating menu to record special actions.

4.  Click **Stop** to stop the Recorder from recording further browser actions as test steps. Do note that this is required before you perform the next step. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Cloud_Studio/Images/Select_Actions_menu_stop.png" width={700} />
