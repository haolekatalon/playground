2.  Enter **WinAppDriver URL**: <code>http://&lt;ip-address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code> - URL to the WinAppDriver server. By default, Katalon Studio is set to <code>http://127.0.0.1:4723</code>.

3.  Click **Add** on the command toolbar to add desired capabilities.

    Katalon Studio supports the same capabilities as WinAppDriver does. To learn more about supported capabilities for Windows Desktop App testing, you can refer to the WinAppDriver document here: [Supported capabilities](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/blob/master/Docs/AuthoringTestScripts.md#supported-capabilities).


### For Native Windows Recorder


:::note

-   Katalon Studio version 7.7.0 onwards.

-   An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license. To learn more about activating licenses, you can refer to this document: [Activate Katalon license](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/activate-a-katalon-license).

To set desired capabilities for Native Windows Recorder, the steps are the same as setting capbilities for Windows Spy/Recorder Utility, see above: [Set desired capabilities for Windows Spy/Recorder Utility](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/set-up-desired-capabilities-in-windows-desktop-app-testing-in-katalon-studio).

Katalon only supports <code>appArguments</code> and <code>appWorkingDir</code> capabilities in Native Windows Recorder.

-   <code>appArguments</code>: Support passing arguments to the Application Under Test. You can also use this desired capabilities to record action without opening a Windows.

-   <code>appWorkingDir</code>: Specify the Application Under Test working directory.

### Example 1: set delaying time for an app launch

The following example shows you how to set desired capabilities to wait for a defined amount of time before initiating an app launch.


:::note

-   Download and install WinAppDriver version 1.2 onwards. You can refer to this document to install WinAppDriver: [Set up WinAppDriver](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/windows-desktop-apps-testing/set-up-winappdriver-in-katalon-studio).
