1.  A valid business email or personal email is eligible for a 30-day trial of Katalon Studio Enterprise \(KSE\) and Katalon Runtime Engine \(KRE\). The trial license is a user-based license for KSE and a floating license for KRE.

    When your trial period expires, you must subscribe to each product to continue using it.

    Currently, the free license for Katalon Runtime Engine is not available.

    If your Enterprise has purchased Katalon licenses but you are not able to use them, check if you have permissions to use the licenses. See [Grant Katalon Licenses](/administer/administration-tasks/license-management/grant-katalon-licenses).
