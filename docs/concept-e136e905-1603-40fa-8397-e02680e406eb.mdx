# Define Method

A method consists of instructions to perform a specific task. Defined methods can be called to use later. For more details regarding how to call a defined method, refer to [Method Call Statements](/create-tests/create-test-cases/statements/method-call-statements).


:::note

-   Once a test step is added as any of the control statements, it is not allowed to change into another keyword.

## In manual view

1.  Open a test case in **Manual** view. Click on the drop-down icon of the Add button, then choose **Method**.

2.  To add a keyword under a statement, select that statement, then click **Add** . A test step is created under that statement.

    The Method builder dialog appears.

3.  Specify the required information for your method as follows:

    <table><tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>The name of the method.</td></tr><tr><td>Return type</td><td>The object type that this method returns after its execution.</td></tr><tr><td>Setup, Teardown options</td><td>Select any checkbox to indicate whether it should be a setUp or tearDown method. Refer to <a href="/create-tests/create-test-cases/statements/statements-in-katalon-studio-overview" >SetUp() and TearDown() in Manual view</a> for more details.</td></tr><tr><td>Parameter list</td><td><p>Any parameter needed to pass into the method.</p> <p>By clicking on the <strong>Insert</strong> button, a row will be appended into the grid. You can then change the type and name of the parameter by double-clicking and editing them.</p></td></tr>    </tbody></table>

4.  After configuring the method details, click **OK**.

    A test step representing the recently defined method is added to the test case. You can switch to the script view to define content for the method.

5.  When you're done, save the test case.


## In script view

The **Script** view of a test case allows you to programmatically define and handle methods using Groovy or Java language. For details about methods in Groovy, refer to Groovy documentation:  [Methods](http://groovy-lang.org/structure.html#_methods) .

For example:

-   **Method declaration** :

    ```
    Integer myMethod(def param1, def param2) { return param1 + param2 }
    ```

-   **Method call** :

    ```
    myVar = myMethod1(varA, varB)
    ```
