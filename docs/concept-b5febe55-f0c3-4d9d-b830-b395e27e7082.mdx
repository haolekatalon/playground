## Grant a license

You can assign licenses to users. See [Grant Katalon Licenses](/administer/administration-tasks/license-management/grant-katalon-licenses).

Once you have assigned a license successfully, users can follow this activation guide: [Activate Katalon License](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/activate-a-katalon-license).

## Remove a license

You can remove a Licensed User, a machine ID, or a license from a machine ID. See [Remove a License](/administer/administration-tasks/license-management/remove-a-license).

## Transfer a license

After activation, the licenses are bound to your user account until their expiry dates, or until they are reassigned to another user account. You can still remove the licenses or transfer them manually.

To transfer a KSE per-User license, you need to:

1.  Remove a license. See [Remove a License](/administer/administration-tasks/license-management/remove-a-license).
2.  Add the new user in the **Licensed Users** section. See: [Grant Katalon Licenses](/administer/administration-tasks/license-management/grant-katalon-licenses).

For KRE, one session will reserve one license. You must deactivate the machine ID that reserved that license first. Another user can then use KRE and take over the license.

For example, if the KRE license is bound to your machine ID because you have run KSE using KRE. You must deactivate your machine ID so that the other member in your organization can use the KRE license.

### Transfer the KRE license to another machine

All licensed Users in an Organization can use available KRE licenses by default once the Organization has purchased the KRE licenses.

Licensed Users activate a KRE license by running KSE with KRE. After activation, their machine ID is then added to the **Online Licenses** section. This license is then reserved for their use.

Therefore, to make a KRE license available when all licenses are reserved, a machine ID has to be deactivated.

To deactivate a machine ID, see: [Remove a registered machine ID](/administer/administration-tasks/license-management/remove-a-license#).
