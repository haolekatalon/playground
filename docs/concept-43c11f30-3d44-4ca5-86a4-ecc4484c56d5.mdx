# Test automation workflow

The following is an overview of the test automation workflow with Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\), from creating your draft test cases to scheduling a test run of your Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test suite.

1.  A Katalon user, on a project, creates and test runs draft Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test cases; and subsequently publish them to a connected Git repository using the Katalon Editor. See: [Create a draft test case](/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio/create-and-manage-a-draft-test-case/create-a-draft-test-case)

2.  The user can create a new test suite and add published Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) and Katalon Studio test cases. See: [Create a Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test suite](/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio/create-and-manage-a-test-suite/create-a-katalon-cloud-studio-beta-test-suite).

3.  The user can schedule a test run on the test suite powered by the Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) Local Engine. See: [Schedule a Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test suite](/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio/execute-cloud-studio-beta-tests/schedule-a-cloud-studio-beta-test-suite).

4.  Once the scheduled run of the test suite is completed, a report is automatically generated and organized in **Reports** &gt; **Test Runs** for review and analysis. See: [View your Cloud Studio \(Beta\) test suite report](/create-tests/create-tests-using-katalon-cloud-studio/analyze-cloud-studio-beta-tests/view-your-cloud-studio-beta-test-suite-report).
