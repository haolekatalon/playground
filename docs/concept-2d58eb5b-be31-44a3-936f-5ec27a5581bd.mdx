# Upload test execution results from Katalon Studio to TestRail

When uploading the execution results of a test suite to TestRail as a Test Run, you can upload the test results to a new Test Run or upload test runs to an existing Test Run in TestRail.

## Requirements

-   You have configured TestRail integration in Katalon Studio. See [Configure TestRail integration in Katalon Studio](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/configure-testrail-integration-in-katalon-studio).


## Upload test results to a new test run in TestRail

To upload test results from Katalon Studio to a new test run in TestRail, follow these steps:

1.  In Katalon Studio, create a new test suite or a dynamic test suite.

2.  Prepend the name of the test suite with the text <code>S&lt;ID&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code> is the test suite ID of your choice.

3.  Add the mapped test cases to the test suite.

4.  Execute a test suite.

    A new Test Run is created in your TestRail project.

5.  To view the Test Run details, click on the Test Run.

6.  In case you want to upload multiple test results to TestRail at the same time, you can add mapped test suites to a test suite collection.

    Katalon Studio will generate separate Test Runs in TestRail in correspondence with the executed Katalon test suites.


## Upload test results to an existing Test Run in TestRail

To upload test results to an existing Test Run in TestRail, follow these steps:

1.  In Katalon Studio, create a new test suite or a dynamic test suite.

2.  Prepend the name of the test suite with the text <code>R&lt;ID&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code> is the **Test Suite ID** of your choice.

    To view the **Test Run ID**, open your TestRail project and click on the Test Run. The ID is displayed next to the Test Run name.

    We can see that <code>R8</code> is the ID of the created Test Run.

    We prepend the Test Suite with the text <code>R8</code> as follows:

3.  Add the mapped test cases to the test suite.

    If you are executing a dynamic test suite, you can query test cases associated with an existing Test Run in TestRail. See [Query test cases linked to TestRail in a dynamic test suite](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/query-test-cases-linked-to-testrail-in-a-dynamic-test-suite).

4.  Execute a test suite.

    After we execute the Test Suite, the **R8** Test Run is updated with new test results.
