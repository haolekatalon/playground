# Generate test scripts for a Progressive Web App using mobile recorder in Katalon Studio

A Progressive Web App \(PWA\) is a modern web application that feels like a web app and works like a native app. It offers rich features such as *Offline mode* and *Push* notifications and creates home screen shortcuts as native apps do. It combines the best features of web apps and native apps.

This user guide shows you how to record and generate test scripts of a PWA using a mobile recorder. In this example, we wish to record and generate test scripts for the launch of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) from the home page of a mobile browser. If you want to test the PWA on a Cloud device, you can use any of the browser testing tools available, such as *Kobiton*, *LambdaTest*, *Browserstack*, etc. We have opted to use BrowserStack as the tool of choice. The use case that you wish to accomplish can be as follows:

-   Open the *Chrome* browser on your mobile device.
-   Type the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) URL in the *Chrome* browser.
-   Open the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) website.


:::note

-   Android mobile device with a Universal Serial Bus \(USB\) data cable.
-   Application Under Test \(AUT\): E.g. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) on your mobile.
-   Browserstack AUT ID: The AUT ID you use based on your Cloud provider.

For more information on how to set up your Android mobile device to test Android applications with **Katalon Studio**, refer to [Android Setup for mobile devices](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/mobile-testing/android/mobile-android-setup-in-katalon-studio#).

You can also use an Android Studio Emulator to test Android applications. This eliminates the need for a mobile device physically connected to your system. For more information on how to configure an Android Studio Emulator, refer to [Configure Android Studio Emulator for mobile devices](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/mobile-testing/android/mobile-configure-android-studio-emulator-in-katalon-studio#).

To generate test scripts using a mobile recorder, perform the following steps:

## Create and run your Android test case

For more information on how to create and run your Android test case, refer to [\[Mobile\] Create and Run Android Test Case](/get-started/sample-projects/mobile/mobile-create-and-run-android-test-case#).

## Configure the remote server settings in Katalon Studio

1.  Launch **Katalon Studio** and go to **Project** &gt; **Settings**.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/generate%20test%20scripts%20using%20mobile%20recorder/K.S.E-8.3.0-generate_test_scripts_configuration_project_settings.png" width={500} />

2.  The **Project Settings** page appears. Go to **Desired Capabilities** &gt; **Remote**.

    The remote server details display accordingly.

    For more information on configuring your project settings in BrowserStack, refer to [BrowserStack Integration](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/integration-with-other-vendors-for-cloud-execution/browserstack-integration).

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/generate%20test%20scripts%20using%20mobile%20recorder/K.S.E-8.3.0-generate_test_scripts_configuration_project_settings_remote.png" />

    Enter the following remote server information:

    -   **Remote server URL**: Enter the URL of your remote server. E.g. http://hub.browserstack.com/wd/hub
    -   **Remote server type**: Select **Appium** in the dropdown list.
    -   **Appium driver**: Select **Android Driver** in the dropdown list.
3.  Specify whether you want to start the recording with an *Application File* or *Application ID*.

    -   Application File: Browse to your tested application \(.apk file for Android; .ipa file for iOS\)
    -   Application ID: Specify the Application ID of your tested application, which is either the package name of an Android app or the bundle identifier of an iOS app.

        For more information about how to set up the configuration using *Application File* or *Application ID*, refer to [Introduction to Mobile Recorder](/create-tests/record-and-spy/mobile-record-and-spy-utilities/introduction-to-mobile-recorder-in-katalon-studio#).


## Recording the desired use case

1.  On the main toolbar of **Katalon Studio**, go to **Action** &gt; **Record** &gt; **Record Mobile**.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/generate%20test%20scripts%20using%20mobile%20recorder/K.S.E-8.3.0-generate_test_scripts_record_mobile_option.png" width={500} />

2.  Click **Start** to begin recording your use case.

    
    :::note

    -   You have to Wait until the AUT launches and the **Device View** and **All Objects** sections are ready for you to interact with the application.

## Troubleshooting

An error message appears when you install the Android Studio emulator:

If your system runs on an Advanced Micro Devices \(AMD\) processor, you might get an *Android Emulator Hypervisor Driver for AMD Processors is not installed* error message.

<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/generate%20test%20scripts%20using%20mobile%20recorder/K.S.E-8.3.0-generate_test_scripts_amd_processor_error.png" alt="Error in the Android Studio" />

To solve this error, you can follow these steps:

1.  Go to **Control Panel** &gt; **Programs and Features** &gt; **Windows Features**.

2.  Clear the **Hyper-V Platform** and **Hyper-V Management Tools** checkboxes, respectively.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/generate%20test%20scripts%20using%20mobile%20recorder/K.S.E-8.3.0-generate_test_scripts_record_clear_hyper-V.png" width={500} alt="Clear Hyper-V platform and Hyper-V Management Tools checkboxes" />

3.  Reboot the system and access *Bios* &gt; *SVM Mode*.

    Depending on the processor, *Secure Virtual Machine \(SVM Mode\)* is known by different names such as *Virtualization/Inter Virtual Technology*, etc.

    In some processors such as *Ryzen*, you can locate *SVM* under *Configurations* &gt; *SVM Mode* while in others such as *Gigabyte*, you can locate it under *M.I.T* &gt; *SVM Mode*.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/generate%20test%20scripts%20using%20mobile%20recorder/K.S.E-8.3.0-generate_test_scripts_svm_location.png" width={500} alt="Access the SVM mode" />

4.  Change the SVM Mode option from Disabled to Enabled.

5.  Restart your system and proceed with the Android emulator installation.
