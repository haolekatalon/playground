# Spy and Record Utilities for testing an existing application in Katalon Studio


:::note

-   Starting with **Katalon Studio version 6.3.0**, you can spy and record testing an installed application on Android and iOS devices, NOT on Kobiton and remote ones.

:::

1.  Open **Mobile Object Spy**/**Mobile Recorder** with Android or iOS devices.

2.  In configurations, you can start spying or recording on an existing application with an application ID. Select **Application ID**, enter the [application ID](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/mobile-keywords/mobile-start-existing-application) in the corresponding text field, the **Start** button will be enabled.


In **Mobile Recorder**

-   In **Recorded Actions**, the first action is **Start Existing Application**.

-   After you press **OK** button to finish its recording session, Katalon Studio will generate script with <code>Mobile.startExistingApplication(appId)</code>.
