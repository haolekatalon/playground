# Understand waiting keywords in Katalon Studio

When a condition is not met, Katalon Studio returns a result \(either *True* or *False*\) with a warning message regardless of what failure handling settings you specified.

In other words, Katalon Studio continues running despite a test's failure. This behavior is similar to choosing the *Optional* value for failure handling. See: [Failure Handling](/maintain/configure-failure-handling-settings-in-katalon-studio).

In case the waiting keyword fails due to such errors as a network problem, session timeout, or because the AUT didn't start, failure handling then applies your specified settings.

For example, if you use the waiting keyword, <code>WaitForElementPresent</code>, Katalon Studio only returns a *True* or *False* result in respect of the element's presence. If the element is not present on the current view, Katalon Studio returns a *False* result and shows a warning message \(Failure Handling = Optional\).

If you want to let the test case fail due to the element not being present, use the following script to make it an assertion:

```
boolean present = Mobile.waitForElementPresent(findTestObject('...'), 10)

assert present

```
