Make sure you opt to create a classic PAT, and select **repo** scope to set permission scopes for the PAT.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/upload-tests-via-git-repo/image/Github-Personal_access_token_permission.png" />

    -   For GitLab, refer to this GitLab document: [Personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token).

    -   For AWS CodeCommit, to create username and PAT for Git credentials, refer to this AWS document: [Step 3: Create Git credentials for HTTPS connections to CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-gc.html#setting-up-gc-iam).

7.  In the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** fields, enter your access key ID and secret access key in AWS CodeCommit.

    -   You upload a Git repository that also has a **Login** test case in the <code>Test Cases/Common Test Cases</code> folder.

    -   You check the **Link existing test execution results with test cases having the same paths and names** option.

    -   Once the Git repository is connected successfully, in the **Test Management** tab, you can see the existing test results of the **Login** test case in the <code>&lt;your-git-repo-name&gt;/Test Cases/Common Test Cases</code> folder.
