# Run a draft test case

Learn how to execute a test run on your draft test case in Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\).

## Run a draft test case with a browser extension

Learn how to execute a test run on your draft test case with a browser extension.

1.  From the Project home screen, go to **Tests** &gt; **Test Cases** and select the draft test case you wish to run.

2.  In the Editor view, click **Run**.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Cloud_Studio/Images/Run_test_case_using_browser_extension.png" width={700} />

    Two things happen when you execute a test run:

    -   A test browser opens executing all test steps listed in the draft test case; and

    -   The Katalon Editor displays the progress of the test run via the progress bar<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Cloud_Studio/Images/progress_bar.png" width={700} />

3.  Once the test run is completed, the Editor is updated with the results of the test run \(Passed/Failed\) and other pertinent information about the test run such as:

    -   Number of steps executed in the test run
    -   Number of steps passed/failed/incomplete
    -   Duration of the test run
    -   Test step error summary
    Here's an example of a test run with a <code>Passed</code> result:

    Here's an example of a test run with a <code>Failed</code> result:

You can now run a draft test case using TestCloud in Katalon Cloud Studio \(Beta\) and later versions.

1.  From the Project home screen, go to **Tests** &gt; **Test Cases** and select the draft test case you wish to run.

2.  In the Editor view, click the **Run** dropdown arrow and select **Run with TestCloud** and the following configurations:

    -   Select the OS configuration you want to run the test case under

        -   For Cloud Studio \(Beta\), we only support Linux OS.

    -   Select the browser and version

        -   For Cloud Studio \(Beta\), we only support Chrome 110 and Firefox 110 browsers.
