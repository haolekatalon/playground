# View traceability matrix in Katalon TestOps

Katalon TestOps offers a complete presentation on traceability with the **Traceability Matrix** report.

You can view test cases, defects, and requirements in one central location, making it easier to manage the relationship across requirements, test cases, and defects.

In Katalon TestOps, the **Traceability Matrix** feature allows you to:

-   manage your project effectively with Jira integration.

-   manage Defects linked to Jira bugs for faster debugging.

-   manage Test Cases linked to Jira issues to track Requirements from production through deployment.


Follow these steps:

1.  Enable Jira integration. See: [Jira Settings](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/jira-integration/enable-testops-jira-integration-for-test-management).

2.  [Link Test Cases to Jira Requirements](/plan/integration-for-test-planning/link-test-cases-to-jira-requirements).

3.  [Link Test Results to Jira Defects](/analyze/integration-for-test-analyzing/jira-integration/link-test-runs-to-jira-defects-in-katalon-testops).

4.  Go to **Reports** &gt; **Requirements** &gt; **Traceability Matrix**.


The relationship between Test Cases, Defects and Requirements is visible on the report here.

You can map and track all Requirements in **Traceability Matrix**. It consolidates requirements and the project's results for production review.
