# Parameterize a Web Service Object in Katalon Studio

## Query Parameters


:::note

-   Only available for **RESTful** Web Service requests

:::

Query parameters can be added to a REST request's URL to tailor and filter the response output. When you input a URL, Katalon Studio detects the query parameters \(after the question mark <code>?</code>\) and list them in the table for better management.

## Variables and Parameterizing Request Objects


:::note

-   Available for both **RESTful** and **SOAP** Web Service requests

:::

Katalon Studio provides the **Variables** section with both manual and scripting editors. By using variables in a request object, you can handle the dynamic values of an object's properties and have more control over them. You can add a new variable and declare its properties in the **Variables** tab. To call a variable in a Web Service object, use the **$\{variable\_name\}** syntax as a place holder in any of the supported locations. The values of the pre-defined variables are passed to their place holders, respectively, during runtime. It is called parameterization, and the approach is the same as [parameterizing a WebUI object](/create-tests/test-objects/web-test-objects/manage-web-test-objects-in-katalon-studio).

In the manual view of a test case, when you add a request object, the pre-defined variables are added **automatically**; hence, you don't need to define them again.

### For RESTful request

Katalon Studio supports calling the declared variables in the following places of a RESTful Web Service object.

-   URL
-   Query Parameters
-   HTTP Header
-   HTTP Body
-   Verification

The screenshot below illustrates an example of using the '**status**' variable in a URL.

### For SOAP-based request

The following locations are where you can use the pre-defined variables:

-   WSDL URL
-   Service Endpoint \(available from version 7.5.5\)
-   HTTP Header
-   Request Message
-   Verification

Below is an example of parameterizing the domain URL in a SOAP request's service endpoint.

## Add test requests to a test case

There are multiple ways to add a test request object to a test case Katalon Studio. You can call the web service requests in the Manual View \(keywords test\) or Script View \(test scripts\) of a test case, and verify the responses.
