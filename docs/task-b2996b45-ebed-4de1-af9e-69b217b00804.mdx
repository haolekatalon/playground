# Create a new test case in Katalon Studio

To create a new test case in Katalon Studio, first, open your desired Katalon project. You can learn more about how to open projects at: [Manage test project in Katalon Studio overview](/create-tests/manage-projects/manage-test-projects/manage-test-project-in-katalon-studio-overview)

On the right side of Katalon Studio, you can see the **Tests Explorer** section containing access to all folders of your projects. There are three ways to create a new test case in Katalon Studio:

1.  From the main toolbar, click on **Create new Test Case**.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Create_Test_Cases/Create_A_New_Test_Case/image/ks-841-hero.png" width={700} />

    Or, in the **Tests Explorer** panel, right-click on the **Test Case** folder and select **New** &gt; **Test Case**.

    Alternatively, you can also go to **File** &gt; **New** &gt; **Test Case** from the main menu.

    
    :::tip

    -   For better management, you can also create a new folder by selecting ****Test Cases**** &gt; **New** &gt; **Folder**, then create new test cases inside that folder.

2.  The **New Test Case** dialog appears. Enter your test case name, description, and tag. You can organize your project more efficiently by creating relevant test case names, tags, and providing detailed descriptions.

    After you are done, clickÂ **OK**.

    
    :::note

    -   Tags can be useful for large project management. You can learn how to manipulate tag properties at [Test Case Management With Tags](/organize/manage-tests/dynamic-test-suite/test-case-management-with-tags).

    :::


A new test case is created inside the **Test Case** folder.

Once a new test case is created, it is opened in **Manual** view. This view allows you to create automated tests with little programming skills required. You can switch to the **Script** tab to edit in Script view.
