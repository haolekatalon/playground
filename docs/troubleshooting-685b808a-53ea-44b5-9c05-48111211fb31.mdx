# Connected device not displayed in 'Device Name' list

When you cannot see the connected device displayed in the **Device Name** list, it can be because one of the following causes:

If you do mobile testing with iOS devices, make sure you enable **UI Automation** on the device. Do as follows:

1.  Connect your device to Xcode.

2.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **Developer** and turn on **UIAutomation**.

3.  Check if your device is recognized using the following commands on Terminal:

    ```
    cd /Applications/Katalon\ Studio.app/Contents/Eclipse/configuration/resources/tools/imobiledevice  idevice_id -l
    ```

    
    :::note

    -   If your iOS version is iOS 11, make sure the version of Katalon Studio is 5.3.0+.

If you do mobile testing with Android devices, make sure to turn on the phone developer mode. Do as follows:

1.  Connect your phone to the computer via a USB cable.

2.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **Developer options**, enable**:**

    -   USB debugging – Debug mode when USB is connected.
    -   Install via USB – Allow installing apps via USB.
    -   USB debugging \(Security Setting\) – Allow granting permissions and simulating input via USB debugging.
3.  Make sure a trusted connection is established by tapping on **Trust this computer** whenever this dialog is displayed on your device.
