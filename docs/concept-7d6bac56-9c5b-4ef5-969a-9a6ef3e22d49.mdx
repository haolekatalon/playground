# Execute Test Runs manually in TestOps

You can execute Test Runs one time or regularly by configuring a schedule for Test Runs. See: [Schedule Test Runs](/execute/schedule-test-execution/schedule-test-runs-in-testops).

You can also execute Test Runs manually by following these steps:

1.  Go to your Project &gt; **Test Execution** &gt; **Test Run List**.

2.  Click on the *Run* icon for manual execution.


## View the status of Test Runs

After executing Test Runs, go to **Test Execution**, then select **Test Run Calendar** to check their status in a calendar view.

Click on a Test Run on the calendar to see its summary.

If a Test belongs to a Test Suite, you can also see a summary of the Test Suite here.
