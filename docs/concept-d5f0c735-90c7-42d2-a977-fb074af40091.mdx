# Bearer authentication in Katalon Studio

## Requirements

-   Katalon Studio version 8.4.0 onwards.


## What is Bearer authentication?

Bearer authentication is an HTTP authentication methodology that uses security tokens called bearer tokens. The bearer token is a cryptic string generated by the server in response to a login request. When making requests to protected resources, the client must send this token in the authorization header.

OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 authorization can generate bearer tokens, but if you already have the token, you can use bearer authentication directly in Katalon Studio.

## Use bearer authentication in Katalon Studio

To use the bearer authentication in Katalon Studio, do as follows:

1.  Open a web service test object, then navigate to the **Authorization** tab.

2.  In the dropdown list of **Type**, choose **Bearer**.

4.  To use this bearer authentication, click **Update to HTTP Header**.


The bearer token is added to the **HTTP Header** with the value as <code>Bearer &lt;myBearerToken&gt;</code>.
