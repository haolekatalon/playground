# Cannot connect to Katalon TestOps server. Please check your Internet connection and try again \(2\)

This error message means that the application has failed to communicate with Katalon Server for activation.

1.  Check your Internet connection and try again.

    If you're behind a Proxy Server, before activating Katalon Studio, you need to configure the Authentication Proxy settings. At the bottom of the Activation dialog box, click **Configure Authentication Proxy**. See: [Configure Proxy for Authentication](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/configure-proxy-authentication).
