# Refresh, clean up, and delete a test project in Katalon Studio

## Refresh a project

If the project files have been modified and they are yet to be reflected in Katalon Studio, you can refresh a project to show up-to-date information, do as follows:

1.  Go to **Project** &gt; **Refresh** from the main menu.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Manage_Test_Project/Refresh_Cleanup_Delete_Projects/image/ks-refresh.png" width={300} />


## Clean up a project

You can free up disk space by removing temporary files generated by Katalon Studio, do as follows:

1.  Select **Clean...** under the **File** menu.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Manage_Test_Project/Refresh_Cleanup_Delete_Projects/image/ks-clean-up.png" width={600} />

    These temporary files are stored in the following location in your machine:

    <table><tr><th>OS</th><th>Temp's file location</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Windows</td><td><span>C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Temp\Katalon</span></td></tr><tr><td>Mac</td><td><span>/tmp/Katalon</span></td></tr>    </tbody></table>


## Delete a project

-   To delete a test project, simply close Katalon Studio and delete the directory on the file system.

    
    :::note

    -   In your project folder, if you remove the .prj file, your project is broken and you cannot open this project in Katalon Studio.
