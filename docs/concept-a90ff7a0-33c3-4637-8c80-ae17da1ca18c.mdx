# Git integration authentication with SSH Keys in Katalon Studio


:::note

-   Starting from **version 7.0.0**, Katalon Studio supports connecting to Git with SSH Keys.


:::

In Katalon Studio, you can generate and add SSH keys to SSH agents without coding. With SSH keys, you can clone your project from cloud-hosted services of Git and integrate them with Katalon Studio. Cloud-based Git services include:

-   GitHub
-   GitLab
-   BitBucket
-   Microsoft Azure DevOps

This tutorial shows you how to generate SSH keys and clone a repository from cloud-hosted services of Git with an SSH protocol.

## Requirements

-   An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license.
-   An existing cloud-based Git repository for your projects. You can download or clone our CI sample project from our GitHub repository: [CI sample](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/ci-samples).
-   An existing account for your Git repository of choice.

## Generate SSH keys

To generate new SSH keys, do as follows:

1.  Go to **Katalon Studio** &gt; **Preferences** and select **General**. Click on **Network Connections** &gt; **SSH2**.

    1.  **General** tab: you can manage your SSH home directory and which private key you are using. The the SSH is usually located at <code>:/Users/your&#95;user&#95;name/.ssh</code> or <code>C:\Users\your&#95;user&#95;name\.ssh</code>. The <code>.ssh</code> folder contains your SSH private and public keys, for example: <code>id&#95;rsa</code> or <code>id&#95;rsa.pub</code>.
    2.  **Private keys**: you can view or delete the old keys and only keep the ID key you use.
2.  Switch to **Key Management** tab.

    The dialog appears as below.

    -   Select **Generate DSA Key** or **Generate RSA Key** to generate a new SSH key.
    -   Select **Load Existing Key** to check if you already have an existing SSH key. This action opens your <code>.ssh</code> folder.

    -   You can also generate an RSA key with this command:

        <code>ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your&#95;email@example.com"</code>

        
        :::note

        -   Katalon Studio only supports <code>OpenSSL</code>, not <code>OpenSSH</code> formats.
        :::

3.  Enter the **Passphrase** or leave it empty, then click **Save Private Keys**.

    Enter the file name and click **Save**.

You've successfully generated a pair of public and private keys.

## Clone your project with SSH protocol

You need to enable Git integration. See: [Enable Git integration](/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/git-integration/work-with-git-in-katalon-studio#).

To get a SSH protocol: go to your account on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps, then go to the repository you want to clone to Katalon Studio. Click **Clone** and select **SSH**, then copy the **SSH protocol**.

After enabling Git Integration, you can clone an existing Git repository into a new directory on the local machine.

Do as follows:

1.  In the main toolbar, click on the **Git** icon and select **Clone Project**.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Git-Integration/Git_Integration_Authentication_With_SSH_Keys/images/clone-project-ssh-key.png" width={200} alt="Clone project" />

2.  The **Clone Git Repository** dialog displays.

    Enter a repository URL with SSH Protocol and click **Next**.

3.  Enter the passphrase, if any, then click **OK**.

    The **Branch Selection** dialog appears.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Git-Integration/Git_Integration_Authentication_With_SSH_Keys/images/branch-select-ssh.png" width={500} alt="Branch selection dialog" />

4.  Specify the local location for cloning as well as the initial branch.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Git-Integration/Git_Integration_Authentication_With_SSH_Keys/images/destination-ssh.png" width={500} alt="Local destination" />

    -   **Directory**: the local storage location you want to store your Git repository.
    -   **Initial branch**: all selected branches from the previous step are displayed here. Select the branch to be used initially from this list.
5.  Click **Finish** when you are done. Katalon Studio automatically opens your cloned project.

    To verify settings, go to **Katalon Studio** &gt; **Preferences** and select Team. Click on **Git** &gt; **Configurations**, and select **Repository Settings**. Ensure that the repository is selected correctly with the URL specified.

You've successfully cloned your repositories. You can commit, pull, and push changes to the repositories from Katalon Studio.
