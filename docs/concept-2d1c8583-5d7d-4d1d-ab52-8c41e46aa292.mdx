# Introduction to Web Services Test Object in Katalon Studio

Katalon Studio supports API Testing with both RESTful and SOAP Services. You can import their definitions from different sources, create and test a single test request, or create functional test scripts. Below are some useful documentations for working with Web Service Requests:

## REST

[Create and design a RESTful Test Request](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/rest-request/rest-request-in-katalon-studio). Or you can import Service definitions from:

-   [OpenAPI Specification 3.0](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/import-web-service-objects/import-rest-api-with-openapi-specification-3-0-to-katalon-studio) \(Requirements: Version 7.7 onwards and Katalon Studio Enterprise license\)
-   [WADLs](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/import-web-service-objects/import-restful-requests-from-wadls-to-katalon-studio) \(Required version: 7.7 onwards\)
-   [SoapUI](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/import-web-service-objects/import-web-service-requests-from-soapui-to-katalon-studio) \(Required version: 7.6 onwards\)
-   [OpenAPI Specification 2.0 \(Swagger\)](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/import-web-service-objects/import-restful-requests-with-openapi-specification-2-0-swagger-to-katalon-studio)
-   [Postman](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/import-web-service-objects/import-restful-from-postman-to-katalon-studio)

## SOAP

[Create and design a SOAP Test Request](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/soap-request-in-katalon-studio). Or you can import Service definitions from [WSDLs](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/import-web-service-objects/import-soap-requests-from-wsdls-to-katalon-studio).

## Functionalities

-   [Builder to create and manage Web Service object easily in Script mode](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/web-services-builder-in-katalon-studio).
-   [Parameterize a Web Service object](/create-tests/test-objects/api-test-objects/rest-request/parameterize-a-web-service-object-in-katalon-studio).
