# Native Windows Recorder in Katalon Studio

From version 7.0.0, Katalon supports the recording utility for Desktop apps testing. From version **7.5.0**, Native Windows Recorder is available for Windows machines. This new-generation Windows Recorder gives you a seamless recording experience that is similar to Web Recorder.

## Requirements

-   Your Katalon Studio version must be **7.5.0+**
-   You need an active **Katalon Studio Enterprise** license
-   This feature is supported on **Windows only**
-   [Setting up WinAppDriver](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/windows-desktop-apps-testing/set-up-winappdriver-in-katalon-studio). If your machine hasn't installed it yet, open Katalon Studio and go to **Tools &gt; Windows &gt; Install WinAppDrivers** and follow the set-up wizard.
-   Installing [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)

## Coordinate-based Recording


:::note

-   From **version 7.8**, you can record and locate a Windows element by its relative coordinates.

:::

In **Native Windows Recorder**, with the enabled **coordinate-based recording**, <code>click</code> and <code>rightClick</code> actions are recorded as <code>clickElementOffset</code> and <code>rightClickElementOffset</code> actions respectively. The following keywords are supported:

-   [\[Windows\] Click Element Offset](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/windows-keywords/windows-click-element-offset)
-   [\[Windows\] Right-click Element Offset](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/windows-keywords/windows-right-click-element-offset)

With coordinates-based recording, Katalon Studio records an element's relative coordinates in addition to its selector. For instance, you want to click on the red X part to close a tab in Notepad. Katalon Recorder records the button's offsets \(its relative coordinates to its top-left corner\) as a set of parameters representing an X and Y offset, and save them in clickElementOffset. It uses them to identify the exact location to perform a click action during runtime.

Without that element's offsets, the test engine can only click on the button's center, resulting in a failed test.

## Recording

1.  Right-click on the Windows Recorder icon and select **Native Windows Recorder** to open the Native Windows Recorder windows.

2.  The **Native Windows Recorder** dialog box is displayed. Specify the information at the CONFIGURATIONS section.

    **Application File**: the absolute path to the Windows Executable File \(\*.exe\) on the testing machine. Click the **Browse...** button to locate the application file.

    To start a UWP application, the application's execute file should be:

    -   *ApplicationID* if your app is published on Microsoft store
    -   *PackageFamilyName!Application ID* if your app is still in development.
3.  Click **Start** deploy and open the specified Windows application.

4.  When you hover over an element of the AUT, Katalon Studio highlights the identified object with a red rectangle.

5.  When you perform an action on the AUT, the action is recorded in the **Recorded Actions** section. The list of available actions is the same as Katalon Studio's built-in keywords. You can add any action, call another test case, and/or use Custom Keywords.

6.  All of the specified actions above are recorded at the **Recorded Actions** section.

    In **Captured Objects**, you can view all elements captured during the recording session. Here you can customize the locator of a captured object by modifying it in the **Locator** tab of **Object Properties**. The captured objects’ locators are their absolute XPaths.

7.  When you’re done with recording, click **OK** to save the recorded actions in Katalon Studio.

8.  You will be prompted to save the captured objects in the Object Repository of Katalon Studio. Choose an existing folder or create a new one, then click **OK** to continue.

## Executing a test case

Remember to turn on the WinAppDriver before executing a test case.

Select the **Windows** icon in the **Run** button on the main Toolbar to execute the script.

The Windows test is executed with those recorded steps accordingly.
