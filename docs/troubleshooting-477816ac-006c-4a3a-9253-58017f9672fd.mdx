# Unable to open project: Resource Exception

You encounter the following message in Katalon Studio:

```
Unable to open project: Resource Exception
```

This issue might happen because Katalon Studio fails to read the project description file \(<code>.project</code>\).

1.  Navigate to your project folder.

2.  Delete the <code>.project</code> file.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Troubleshooting_For_Test_Creation/Troubleshooting_Common_Exception/image/project-file.png" width={500} />

3.  Open your project in Katalon Studio again.

    Katalon Studio opens the project successfully.
