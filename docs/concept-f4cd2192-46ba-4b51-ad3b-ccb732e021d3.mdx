# Authorization OAuth 1.0 in Katalon Studio

To learn more about OAuth 1.0, you can refer to OAuth documentation: **[OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A](https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/).**

The following fields are supported in Katalon Studio:

<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Consumer Key</td><td>The API key associated with the application (Twitter, Facebook, etc.). This key (or 'client ID', as Facebook calls it) is what identifies the client, which is a website/service that is trying to access an end-user's resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer Secret</td><td>The client password that is used to authenticate with the authentication server, which is a Twitter/Facebook/etc. server that authenticates the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Signature Method</td><td>The consumer uses either HMAC-SHA1 or RSA-SHA1 to sign the request. For signature method RSA-SHA1, only OpenSSL RSA Private key with PKCS#8 or PKCS#1 format is supported.</td></tr><tr><td>Token</td><td>What is issued to the client once the client successfully authenticates itself (using the consumer key & secret). This access token defines the privileges of the client (what data the client can and cannot access).</td></tr><tr><td>Token Secret</td><td>The string sent with the access token as a password.</td></tr><tr><td>Realm</td><td>The Provider basically decides if this is of any importance. It is the counterpart of the WWW-authenticate response header. If a server returns a WWW-authenticate header of 'OAuth realm="<a href="https://api.example.com/" >https://api.example.com</a>"' then it probably parses that value from the Authenticate request header in the OAuth process.</td></tr></tbody></table>
