# Deprecation of node-locked and floating-license models

## Change to licensing model

The licensing models for Katalon Studio Enterprise \(KSE\) and Katalon Runtime Engine \(KRE\) are changing. KSE node-locked and floating license types as well as KRE node-locked license types are being deprecated. The licensing model for both products are transitioning to the following:

-   KSE node-locked and floating license → [KSE per-user license](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/katalon-studio-enterprise-per-user-license)
-   KRE node-locked and floating license → [KRE floating license](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/katalon-runtime-engine-floating-license)


:::note

-   To learn more about per-user and other license types, refer to [Types of licenses](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/license-overview).

:::

## Technical support for annual or multi-year contracts

If you currently have an annual or multi-year contract, then the deprecating license types will continue to function as expected until the end of your current contract. Once your contract ends, only new license types will be available for use.


:::note

-   For KSE, floating and node-locked licenses cannot co-exist with per-user licenses. You cannot directly purchase per-user licenses until your contract expires or you decide to transition to the new license model.
-   You can contact the Success team at success@katalon.com if you want to immediately convert to the per-user licensing model.

## Migration mapping of KSE floating/node-locked to KSE per-User licenses

### Case 1: Automatic transition to KSE per-user licenses

This case applies to those of you whose license renewal date is due. This happens automatically.

Consider a scenario where you are a group of 5 users have the and you following licenses at your disposal:

-   1 generated offline floating license.
-   3 floating licenses.

As you can see above, the number of people in your group \(5 users\) is more than the number of licenses available \(3 floating licenses\). Thus, when the license renewal date approaches, 3 KSE per-user licenses are issued to your group, based on the following order of priority:

-   1 user with the offline floating license.
-   2 unique users who were last seen active.

Thus, you can say:

*N Offline licenses + O unique last active users = P licenses*

In general, if you have 1,3,4,5……n KSE floating licenses, an equivalent number of last active users receive corresponding per-user licenses.

### Case 2: Manual transition to KSE per-user licenses

This case applies to those who wish to upgrade Katalon licenses or switch to the KSE per-user licenses while the license renewal date is not due.

Consider a scenario where you are a group of 5 users and wish to transition to per-user licenses. To do this:

1.  Go to the [Katalon Pricing](https://www.katalon.com/pricing/) page, select **Katalon Studio**, on the KSE per-User plan, click **Buy now**.

    Alternatively, you can sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login), then go to **Settings** &gt; **Subscription Management**, select **Katalon Studio**, and click **Subscribe** on the KSE per-user plan.

2.  By doing so, you are prompted to confirm whether you wish to merge your existing floating/node-locked licenses to new per-user licenses.


Once you confirm your interest for the transition to per-user licenses, the licenses are assigned to you on order of priority, as it was during automatic renewal.

In case you want to upgrade your plan, after finishing the transition, log into [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/) to upgrade your plan. See: [Upgrade Billing Plan](/administer/administration-tasks/subscription-management/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/upgrade-billing-plan-of-licenses#).

## Migration mapping of KRE floating/node-locked to KRE floating licenses

Depending on the KRE licenses you currently have, the following cases apply.

### Case 1: Users with monthly KRE node-locked licenses only

You can still use your existing KRE node-locked licenses until their renewal date, but you cannot purchase more. If the renewal date is after June 7, 2022, KRE node-locked licenses will be converted into KRE floating licenses.

If you do not cancel the monthly KRE node-locked licenses, they are automatically renewed and converted into monthly KRE floating licenses after June 7, 2022. You then can upgrade the number of monthly KRE floating licenses.


:::note

-   Make sure you cancel KRE node-locked subscriptions before subscribing to the new KRE floating licenses to avoid additional charges.

:::

### Case 2: Users with KRE node-locked and KRE floating licenses

You can still use the current KRE node-locked licenses until their renewal date, but you cannot purchase more.

If you do not cancel the KRE node-locked licenses, they are automatically renewed and converted into KRE floating licenses after June 7, 2022. For example, you have 2 KRE node-locked and 3 KRE floating licenses. If you do not cancel the KRE node-locked subscription, your KRE node-locked licenses will be renewed automatically after June 7, 2022 and become KRE floating licenses. You then have a total of 5 KRE floating licenses from June 8, 2022.

You can upgrade KRE floating licenses normally.

### Case 3: Users with KRE floating licenses only

You can upgrade KRE floating licenses normally.
