# Configure TestRail integration in Katalon Studio

The **TestRail Integration** plugin establishes the connection between Katalon Studio and TestRail to deliver the following advanced capabilities:

-   In TestRail, you can view test results of test suites executed in Katalon Studio.
-   In Katalon Studio, you can query test cases associated with test runs of TestRail in the dynamic test suite.



:::note

-   From version 8.5.5, your TestRail password is encrypted. If you open your project in Katalon Studio version before 8.5.5, you might need to re-enter your TestRail password.

-   The **TestRail Integration** plugin only supports integrating Katalon Studio with TestRail Cloud.
