# Update Katalon Studio


:::caution

-   After installing the new version successfully, product reactivation is required.

:::

The auto-update feature ensures that you work with the most recent version of Katalon Studio, with the latest updates and enhancements. **Katalon Preferences** are carried out to the updated version. By default, Katalon Studio automatically checks for the most recent version every time the application starts.

You can always find the latest update in Katalon Studio by navigating to **Help** &gt; **Check for Updates**.

:::note

-   **Known limitation:** Currently, Katalon Studio Platform Edition for macOS does not support in-app updates to Katalon Studio 8.6.0.
-   **Workaround:** To upgrade to Katalon Studio 8.6.0, you need to download from the Katalon website: [Katalon Studio 8.6.0](https://katalon.mdx).

Suppose a new version is available, the **Katalon Studio New Update** dialog displays. Otherwise, your Katalon Studio is up to date.
