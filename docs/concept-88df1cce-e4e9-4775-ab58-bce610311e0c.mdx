# TestOps Private Instance integration

If data security is a critical concern for you and your business, testing in a secure environment where sensitive information is isolated can be required.

From Katalon Studio version 8.3.5 onwards, you can privately perform tests and upload test results to TestOps Private Instance from Katalon Studio.

This article introduces the TestOps Private Instance offering and shows you how to integrate your private instance with Katalon Studio.

## What is TestOps Private Instance?

TestOps Private Instance is a single-tenant cloud architecture where a single software instance and its supporting infrastructure/database serve only one customer, a.k.a tenant.

Users can have an isolated TestOps instance with separate application nodes, isolated networking, and database resources. This creates a more secure environment than a multi-tenant architecture where a single software instance and database serve multiple customers.

To learn more about single-tenant and multi-tenant architectures, you can refer to this Hubspot blog post: [Single vs Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/single-vs-multi-tenant-saas).

With TestOps Private Instance, you can benefit from:

-   Data isolation: This is helpful for users working with sensitive information and strict data storage requirements.

-   Data residency: This is helpful for users who must confirm where their data lives or have compliance requirements, for example to be in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\).

-   Dedicated Katalon application: For users who have a predictable workload and want stronger guarantees in performance, a dedicated instance ensures that they perform tests without being interrupted by maintenance or scaling issues.

-   No maintenance: While the dedicated instance offers better data isolation and performance, it is still fully managed by Katalon. This relieves customers from infrastructure management.
