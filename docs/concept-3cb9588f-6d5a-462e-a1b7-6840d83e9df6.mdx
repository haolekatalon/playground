# Integrate Katalon Studio with Microsoft Teams

This document shows you how to integrate Katalon Studio with Microsoft Teams so that your team can receive a real-time summary of your test execution results in your Microsoft Teams channels.

## Integrate Katalon Studio with Microsoft Teams

To integrate Katalon Studio with Microsoft Teams, do as follows:

1.  Install our plugin from the Katalon Store: [Microsoft Teams Integration](https://store.katalon.com/product/77/Microsoft-Teams-Integration).

2.  Open Katalon Studio and select **Your Account** &gt; **Reload Plugins**. For detailed instructions, see: [Reload your plugins in Katalon Studio](/plugins-and-add-ons/katalon-store/katalon-studio-plugins/installing-plugin-offline-in-katalon-studio#).

3.  On your Microsoft Teams channel, create an Incoming Webhook to allow Katalon Studio to share content in Microsoft Teams channels. For better notification management, you might want to enter <code>Katalon Studio</code> as your Incoming Webhook connection. For detailed instructions, see the Microsoft document: [Create Incoming Webhooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook).

The URL maps to the channel and you can use it to send information to Teams.

4.  Open Katalon Studio. Go to **Project Setting** &gt; **Plugins** &gt; **Microsoft Teams**.

5.  Enter the Incoming Webhook URL, then click **Apply and Close**.
