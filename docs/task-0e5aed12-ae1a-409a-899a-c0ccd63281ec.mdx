# Add mail recipients in Katalon Studio test suites

-   You have set up a mail server, an email template, and a default recipient list in Katalon Studio. See: [Share test reports via email in Katalon Studio](/analyze/reports/manage-reports/share-test-reports-via-email-in-katalon-studio).


You can add an additional email list of recipients for a specific test suite reports. You can do this in a test suite or dynamic test suite user interface. Follow these steps:

1.  Open a test suite or a dynamic test suite.

2.  Expand the **Execution Information** section. In the **Mail Recipients** box, click **Add**.

3.  An **Add recipient's email** dialog opens. Type in the email you want to send the reports to.


You have successfully added an additional email list to receive a specific test suite report. After the test execution, the default recipient list configured in **Email settings** and the additional list in a test suite can receive the same test report. Duplicated emails only receive one test report.
