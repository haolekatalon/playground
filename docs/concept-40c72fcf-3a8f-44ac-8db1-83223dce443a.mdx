# Link test runs to Jira defects in Katalon TestOps

If a Test Run fails, you can link its Test Result to Jira issues, such as Jira Bugs. You can then view the Test Result of that Test Run in Jira to investigate the Defects.

## Requirements

-   In Jira, install this plugin from the Atlassian Marketplace website: [Katalon Studio and TestOps integration.](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217501/katalon-bdd-test-automation-for-jira)

-   You have configured Jira integration. See: [Enable TestOps - Jira integration for test management](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/jira-integration/enable-testops-jira-integration-for-test-management)

To link a Test Result to a Jira Bug, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your Project.

2.  Go to **Reports** &gt; **Test Runs**.

3.  Select a failed Test Run by clicking on its ID, then click on the **Test Results** tab.

### Quick Tips

You can also install the Katalon Integration Plugin in your Chrome browser. This Plugin allows you to navigate directly to Jira to create a new Jira issue. It then automatically links the Jira issue back to the Test Result you have selected.

Follow these steps:

1.  Download [Katalon Integration Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/katalon-integration/cechonbcopffiimhnkgghckbgipciedg).

    
    :::note

    -   The download is only available on the Chrome browser.

    :::

2.  Enable Katalon Plugin in Chrome Extensions.

3.  Check the **Jira Defects** section in Katalon TestOps again.

    After completing the installation, the *Create* icon is enabled.

4.  Click on the **Create** icon to switch directly to Jira, then create a new Jira issue.

    The new Jira issue is automatically linked to the Test Result you have selected.
