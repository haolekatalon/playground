2.  Record test script via Katalon Recorder and save test objects and test cases. You can refer to [Record web utility in Katalon Studio](/create-tests/record-and-spy/webui-record-and-spy-utilities/record-web-utility-in-katalon-studio).

    You can also use the test in our sample project, by updating the application URL, Username, and Password inside the Default Profile. Refer to [Execution profile](/create-tests/data-driven-testing/execution-profile). <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/Oracle_Cloud_application/KS-execute_oracle_sample_test.png" alt="execute Oracle sample test" />

3.  Run the test execution. You can refer to [Execute tests with Katalon Studio overview](/execute/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio-overview).

4.  Verify the test execution result. You can refer to [View test results and execution logs in Katalon TestOps](/analyze/reports/view-test-reports/view-test-reports-in-katalon-testops/view-test-run-results/view-test-results-and-execution-logs-in-katalon-testops/view-test-results-and-execution-logs-in-katalon-testops).
