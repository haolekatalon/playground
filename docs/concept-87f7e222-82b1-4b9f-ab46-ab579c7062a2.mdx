## Edit credit card information

In Katalon TestOps, only credit cards are supported, and you can only save one card in each organization.

If you wish to replace a pre-existing credit card, go to the **Payment Method** section, then click **Update**.

This card is now the default for all billing purposes, including subscription renewals.
