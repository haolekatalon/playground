# How to cancel scheduled Test Runs in TestOps

On Katalon TestOps, you can schedule test runs to be executed repeatedly. However, sometimes your testing plans change, and you might no longer need these test runs to be executed as scheduled. This section guides you to cancel scheduled test runs that are no longer required in your testing plan.

1.  Login to Katalon TestOps and go to your project. Go to **Reports** and select **Test Runs** &gt; **Test Runs**.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Schedule_test_executions/Cancel-scheduled-test-run/image/TestOps-Test-Runs.png" alt="test runs" />

2.  Scroll down to the **All Test Runs** section, and select the scheduled test run that you wish to cancel by clicking on the **ID** of that test run. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Schedule_test_executions/Cancel-scheduled-test-run/image/TestOps-select-Test-Runs.png" alt="select test run ID" />

    The test run summary page appears as below:<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Schedule_test_executions/Cancel-scheduled-test-run/image/TestOps_-_test_run_detail.png" alt="Test run result detail" />

3.  Open the configuration of the selected test run by clicking on the **Configurations** icon.

4.  Click on **Edit**.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Schedule_test_executions/Cancel-scheduled-test-run/image/TestOps-TestOps-Configurations-Edit.png" alt="select configurations edit" />

    The **Scheduled Test Run** dialog appears.

5.  In the **Where to run** section, toggle off the **Repeat** option and select **Save Configurations** instead of **Schedule Automated Test**.
