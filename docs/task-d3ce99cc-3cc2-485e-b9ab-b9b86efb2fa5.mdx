# View Katalon Studio test results in Jira tickets

-   You have enabled Jira integration in Katalon Studio. See [Configure Jira integration in Katalon Studio](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/jira-integration/configure-jira-integration-in-katalon-studio).


With Jira integration, after a test suite execution Katalon Studio automatically uploads the latest test results and attaches a <code>.zip</code> file that contains test reports to the linked Jira ticket.

1.  To view the test results, open the linked Jira ticket, click **Open Test Results** in the **Details** group.

-   You can quickly find the test execution status via the JQL query. The syntax is as follows: <code>"Katalon Status"=status</code>
-   For example, to search for all issues that have failed in the Katalon Studio test execution, type <code>"Katalon Status"=FAIL</code> in the search bar. Katalon Studio supports five test statuses: **Passed**, **Failed**, **Incomplete**, **Error**, and **Skipped**.
-   When you view test results in Jira, ensure that you enable file attachments. To do this, follow instructions as given in the Jira document: [Configuring file attachments](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-file-attachments-938847851.html).
