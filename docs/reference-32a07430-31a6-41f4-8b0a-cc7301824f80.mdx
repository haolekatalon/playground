To help our team troubleshoot and assist with any issues, you should provide as much detailed information as possible, including execution logs, error logs, test artifacts, documentation.We will use those information to reproduce your issue.

## What type of request I can submit?

Katalon Platform subscribers will be provided with helpdesk accounts for product support. The number of helpdesk accounts equals the number of your active valid licenses. There is no limit on the number of support requests you can submit on our Support Portal, but the ticket will be processed on an one by one basis.

Below are the two types of requests that may be submitted:

-   **Error Reporting**: For requests related to errors. An error refers to a material failure of a KSE version, KRE or Katalon Platform to perform substantially in accordance with functional specifications published in its documentation. Submitted errors will be verified by our development team. We will estimate a resolution timeline and regularly update with you.
-   **Feature Suggestion**: Users may submit suggestions to add features to Katalon platform. Katalon will consider feature suggestions and assess them based on the evaluation by the product development team. Katalon will inform the submitter of the status of the suggestion.
