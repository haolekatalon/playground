# Quick guide for billing managers

As a billing manager, you can change subscriptions and manage payments. You can also view license management settings.

## Subscription management

To get started, view your current license details and assess whether or not you need to upgrade.

## Check your organization's license details

A billing manager can check what licenses their organization has. To verify, follow the directions below.

Go to Katalon TestOps to view the details of your current license.

1.  Log in to your Katalon TestOps account through [this link](https://testops.katalon.io/login).

2.  From the TestOps homepage, click on the dropdown menu on the upper left. Select the name of the organization whose license you want to check. <img src="/doc_images/Global_reuse/Common_tasks_warehouse/Katalon_KatOne/Quick_guide_for_billing_managers_page/Check_your_license_details_topic/task-5122-images/1_homepage_testops_choose_organization.png" alt="Click on the organization which you want to check the license of." />

3.  Click on the Settings Icon found in the upper right of the screen to access **Settings**. Then, click on **License Management**. <img src="/doc_images/Global_reuse/Common_tasks_warehouse/Katalon_KatOne/Quick_guide_for_billing_managers_page/Check_your_license_details_topic/task-5122-images/2_go_to_license_management.png" alt="Click on Settings in the Katalon TestOps homepage to access the License Management menu." />


You are brought to the **License Management** page, where active subscriptions for Katalon Studio Enterprise \(per-user\) are shown by default under the **Subscription Details** section.<img src="/doc_images/Global_reuse/Common_tasks_warehouse/Katalon_KatOne/Quick_guide_for_billing_managers_page/Check_your_license_details_topic/task-5122-images/3_subscription_details.png" alt="The License Management page shows all subscriptions in that organization." />

View your licenses for Katalon Runtime Engine \(Floating\) and Katalon Runtime Engine DevOps by clicking on the tab of the same name. The current license you are viewing is indicated by a blue line under the tab label.

## Manage Subscription

Should you need to expand your testing capacities, you can add TestCloud and Visual Testing quotas at any time.

You can also add a license for [Katalon Runtime Engine overview](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/katalon-runtime-engine-overview) if you need to run tests in CLI \(command-line interface\) mode.

All of these are available in the **Additional Products**section within **Subscription Management**.
