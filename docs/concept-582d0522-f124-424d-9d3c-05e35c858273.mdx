# Katalon Runtime Engine floating license

Katalon Runtime Engine \(KRE\) is the test execution add-on of Katalon Studio. While the KSE license only supports you in generating test scripts and manually executing tests via the graphical user interface, the KRE license allows you to execute automated tests in CI/CD pipelines or via the command-line interface \(CLI\).

When running via CLI, each floating license only allows one active session, which means one single test suite or test case being executed at a time. For example, 25 test suites in 1 test suite collection will run sequentially not in parallel. If you want to run in parallel, you can separate the number of test suites and test suite collection into smaller ones. The number of licenses will be equal to the number of test suite collections.To learn more about the use cases of KRE, see [Introduction to Katalon Runtime Engine](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/katalon-runtime-engine-overview).

The table below provides information on the KRE floating license:
