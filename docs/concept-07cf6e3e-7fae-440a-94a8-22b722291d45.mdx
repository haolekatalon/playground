# Export test projects from Katalon Recorder

From version 5.6.0 onwards, Katalon Recorder \(KR\) you can export multiple tests into a single file. This file is compatible with many other frameworks, such as Katalon Studio, Java Maven or Python. From version 5.9.0 onwards, you can export your project to Selenium 4.

The export feature is especially useful to outgrow the capabilities of KR. As your work requirements and projects complexity increase, you can move your test artifacts and projects to other frameworks. This allows you to benefit from further advanced testing without losing your work.

The table below shows the full list of exporting features that KR offers, compared with Selenium IDE:
