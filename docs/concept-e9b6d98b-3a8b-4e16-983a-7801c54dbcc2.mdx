# Cancel TestCloud Subscriptions

You can cancel your subscription at any time.

Canceling a subscription will turn off the automatic renewal of your subscription.

The cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period, and you can continue using your subscription until the expiry date.

After canceling your subscription, if your subscription has yet to reach the expiry date, you can reactivate your canceled subscription.

This article shows you how to cancel and reactivate TestCloud subscriptions.


:::note

-   You must be the Owner or Billing Manager of your Katalon Account. Learn more about roles and permissions at [Roles and permissions](/administer/administration-roles/administrative-roles-and-permissions).
