# Katalon Help in Katalon Studio

In case you need some help using Katalon Studio, we have you covered.

## Requirements

In the search bar of the **Help** menu, type in keywords related to your issue. The results are divided into two categories:

## Quickstart guide

You might see the **Quickstart guide** at the very beginning when you first use Katalon Studio. Katalon Studio supports onboarding tours with tooltips to guide you through each step for:

-   WebUI
-   API
-   BDD

You can always return to the guide to replay the onboarding instructions. After opening your test project, go to **Help** &gt; **Quickstart guide**.

From version 8.6.5, Katalon Studio presents a checklist of six steps to show you how to:

-   Create your first project
-   Write your first test case
-   Plan your tests with a test suite
-   Analyze your test activities with Cloud Platform
-   Try cross-browser cloud testing
-   Execute test via CI/CD pipeline with Katalon Runtime Engine \(KRE\)<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Get_Started/Set_Up_Your_Workspace/Katalon_Help/image/ks-865-quickstart-guide.png" width={600} alt="Quick Start dialog" />

From version 8.4.0, Katalon Studio introduces the onboarding tour for behavior-driven development \(BDD\) testing. To access the BDD onboarding tour, you need to create or open a Generic Project. Then, choose BDD as the type of automated testing.

If you run your Katalon project with Jenkins, the runtime log is located at: <code>.jenkins/jobs/&lt;your project name&gt;/builds/&lt;build number&gt;/log</code>

For example, in macOS: <code>/Users/username/.jenkins/jobs/ci-samples-master/builds/1/log</code>
