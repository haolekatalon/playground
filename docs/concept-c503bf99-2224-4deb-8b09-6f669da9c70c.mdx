# View captured screenshots in Katalon Studio reports

With Katalon Studio, you can capture screenshots during test execution.

Capturing screenshots helps you identify the problem when a test fails. By doing so, you can debug the test script more effectively and quickly.

By default, Katalon Studio captures screenshots automatically upon test failures. This feature is currently applicable to Web UI and Mobile testing.

## View screenshots

When a test suite fails, you can either open a test suite's report or go to a test suite's **Result** tab for captured screenshots.

To view the captured screenshots in a test suite's **Results** tab, follow these steps:

1.  Select the failed Test Suite.
2.  Open its **Result** tab.
3.  Select a failed test case.
4.  Click **Show Test Case Details** on the top right corner.

    The Test Case's Log then appears.

5.  Click on the **Image** tab.

To view the captured screenshots in a test suite's report, click **Export report** and select the file type \(HTML, CSV or PDF\), then open the exported file for viewing.

You can also use the captured screenshots \(screenshots taken as checkpoints\) for visual testing with TestOps Visual Testing. See: [Visual Testing](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/use-testops-visual-testing).

## Deactivate screenshots

To turn off the default settings, do as follows:

-   For version **7.8 onwards**:

    Go to **Project &gt; Settings &gt; Execution**. In the displayed **During-Execution Options** panel, uncheck **Take Screenshot when execution failed**, and click **Apply and Close**.

-   For versions **before 7.8**:

    Go to **Project &gt; Settings &gt; Report**. In the displayed **Report** view, uncheck **Take Screenshot when execution failed**, and click **OK**.


## Configure screenshots manually

If you wish to manually set the conditions for capturing screenshots during tests, you can use the following built-in keywords for Web UI and Mobile testing:

-   [\[WebUI\] Take Screenshot](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/web-ui-keywords/webui-take-screenshot)
-   [\[WebUI\] Take Screenshot As Checkpoint](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/visual-based-web-testing-keywords/webui-take-screenshot-as-checkpoint) \(Available from 7.7\)

### Configure screenshots in Manual mode in Katalon Studio

If you are not familiar with coding in Script mode, you can also insert built-in keywords in Manual mode.

Follow these steps:

1.  Open Katalon Studio and go to your Project.
2.  Select a Test Case in Manual mode.

    The Test Case shows all Test steps.

    Double click on a Test step and choose options \(as shown in the picture below\).

    You have added a new Test step in Manual mode.

3.  Double click on the new Test step, and enter the keyword.

    A list of built-in keywords for capturing screenshots displays as below.
