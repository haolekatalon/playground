# Katalon API Keys in Katalon Store

## Use of Katalon API Keys in Katalon Store

During command-line execution, Application Programming Interface \(API\) Keys act as your credentials to download and install plugins in **Katalon Studio** before execution.

If API keys are not applied, **Katalon Studio** proceeds with test execution as you have not installed any plugins yet. Therefore, the API key is a must-have when you use a plugin during test execution in console mode.

## Manage API Keys in Katalon Store

You can manage Katalon API Keys from **Katalon Store**. Do as follows:

1.  Navigate to Katalon Store **My Account**, then select the **Security** tab.

2.  Click on **Manage your API Keys in Katalon TestOps**.

    You are directed to the **Katalon API Key** section of **Katalon TestOps**, where you can generate, use, and remove API Keys.

    For more details on how you can manage API Key in **Katalon TestOps**, refer to this document: [API Keys](/administer/settings/katalon-api-key-in-katalon-testops).
