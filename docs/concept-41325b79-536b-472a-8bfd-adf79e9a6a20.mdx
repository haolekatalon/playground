# Verification Snippets in Katalon Studio

Katalon Studio supports the ability to write verification scripts directly in the details of the web service object. The **Verification Snippets** reduces the time of going back and forth between the test case and the request object to add test scripts. Verifying the response can be done instantaneously.

To access the **Verification snippets**, click on the **Verification** tab of the web service request object.

## Using Verification Snippets

When you click on one of the available snippets, Katalon Studio automatically generates a snippet for you.


:::note

-   The generated snippet is only an example. You should not try to use them immediately without making adjustments to match your needs.

You can also verify the data of the XML or JSON response body. To add these verification scripts, in the **Response** panel, switch to JSON or XML response body, select the data, and press key combination <code>Ctrl</code> / <code>Command</code> + <code>K</code>.

Katalon Studio compares the values in the response body with the predefined values in verification scripts.

Once the verification snippets are generated, you can use them in either your current web service request object or in your test case.

-   In the web service request object, click on the drop-down of **Test Request** and select **Test Request and Verify**.

    This action sends the current request and also executes verification snippets. Verification logs executed using verification snippets are displayed on the **Verification Log** tab. If you do not want to send a test request using current verification snippets, then just click on **Test Request**.

-   In a test case, use the <code>WS.sendRequestAndVerify</code> keyword. This keyword also sends the current request and executes verification snippets. For example:

    ```
    WS.sendRequestAndVerify(findTestObject('Your_Test_Object'))
    
    ```

    The execution results are displayed in the **Log Viewer** tab.
