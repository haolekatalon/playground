# Transfer Ownership


:::note

-   You must be the Owner of your Organization.


:::

You may want to transfer ownership in the following circumstances:

-   When you want to change your current email address.
-   When you want to transfer your Organization to another member.

## Transfer ownership to an existing member


:::note

-   You have invited the user to join your Organization. See: [Invite users to join an Organization](/administer/administration-tasks/user-management/manage-users#).

Follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login).

2.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **User Management**.

    The **User Management** page appears. You can see a list of active members in the **Active Users** section.

3.  Mouse over the member you want to select, then click on the *Extension* icon at the end of the row.

5.  Check the email address you want to transfer ownership to.

    :::note

    -   You cannot undo this action.

    :::


You have transferred the Organization to the selected email address/member.

That member is now the Owner of your Organization. The new Owner has all privileges \(including ownership transfering\) in the Organization. See: [Roles and permissions](/administer/administration-roles/administrative-roles-and-permissions).

After transfering ownership, your role has automatically become the **Admin** role.


:::note

-   Transferring Organization ownership does not affect Team ownership. The previous Organization Owner maintains Owner permissions for the Teams they have created.

## Transfer ownership to a new email address

As an Owner of an Organization, the email address you have registered with Katalon TestOps is bound to your TestOps Organization and becomes a unique ID. You cannot change this unique ID.

If you want to change your email address, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new account using your new email address.
2.  Send an invitation to join the Organization to the new email address. See: [Invite users to join an Organization](/administer/administration-tasks/user-management/manage-users#).
3.  Join the Organization as a new user. See: [Join TestOps Organizations](/administer/administration-tasks/join-a-testops-organization).
4.  Transfer ownership to the new email address. See: [Transfer Ownership](/administer/administration-tasks/user-management/transfer-ownership#).
5.  Delete the old account. See: [Remove existing users](/administer/administration-tasks/user-management/manage-users#).
