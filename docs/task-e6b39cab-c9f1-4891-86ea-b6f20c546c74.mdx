# View execution reports in TestOps

You can integrate Katalon Recorder with [Katalon TestOps](https://www.katalon.com/testops/) to upload and view execution reports. Do as follows:

1.  Visit [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/) and log in using your Katalon account.

2.  Create a TestOps project. If this is the first time you log in to TestOps, you need to create a new organization. See [Create Organization and Project.](https://docs.katalon.com/docs/katalon-testops/get-started/create-organization-and-project)

3.  Execute tests in Katalon Recorder. You might need to close and open Katalon Recorder again for the integration to be fully enabled.

4.  Upload test executions to TestOps.

    1.  In the **ACTION**section, click on **Upload report**.

        The **Katalon TestOps** dialog appears.

    2.  Choose a TestOps project if you have multiple TestOps projects.
