# Set up Docker Test Environments for TestOps

Similar to [Create a Local Test Environment with an Agent](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/create-a-local-test-environment-with-an-agent), you can create a Docker Test Environment with a compatible Agent in Katalon TestOps.

## Set up an Agent

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your Project.
2.  Go to **Configurations** &gt; **Agent Setup**.
3.  Select the **Docker Environment** tab.

    The page appears as below.

4.  Fill in the required information for the **Configure an agent** and **Select method** sections.

    
    :::note

    -   You then use the commands in the **Generate configuration** and **Start an agent** sections to run the Agent in your computer.

    :::

5.  Leave the TestOps page open while following the instructions to start an Agent in your local machine.


## Start an Agent

1.  Create a folder \(e.g, **Docker** folder\) in your computer.

2.  Open a new Notepad file in your computer, then copy and paste the command in the **Generate configuration** section into the new file.

3.  Save the file as .yml file in the folder you have created \(as shown in the pictures below\).

4.  Search "cmd" in the Windows explorer search bar, then press *Enter*.

5.  Copy and paste the command in the **Start an agent** section into your cmd to start an Agent.

You have started your Docker with an Agent. You can open your Docker to see the Agent running.

## View an Agent's status

In Katalon TestOps, go to the **Test Environments** page to see the Docker Test Environment you have created and its status.
