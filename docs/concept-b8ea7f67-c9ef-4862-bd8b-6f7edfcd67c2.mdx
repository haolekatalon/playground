# Hybrid mobile apps testing in Katalon Studio overview

Katalon Studio partially supports hybrid mobile apps. You can view the supported environments here: [Supported environments](/supported-execution-environments/supported-environments-for-katalon-studio-and-katalon-runtime-engine-kre).

If elements of a hybrid app are rendered as in a native app, Katalon Mobile Recorder/Spy utility can capture elements. You can learn how to capture elements in the Katalon Mobile Recorder/Spy utility in the following documents:

-   [Mobile Spy Tutorials](/create-tests/record-and-spy/mobile-record-and-spy-utilities/spy-mobile-utility-in-katalon-studio)

Suppose those elements are rendered in WebView or a Flutter-based app, which are use cases of a hybrid mobile app. In that case, Katalon Studio provides some workarounds for capturing elements in the following documents:
