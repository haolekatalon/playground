## Override authentication

You might need to override authentication when you want to integrate Katalon Studio with Katalon TestOps using a TestOps private instance. To learn more about TestOps private instance offering and how to enable your private instance from Katalon Studio.


:::note

-   From version 8.6.0 onwards, you can override authentication with **TestCloud** in Katalon Studio.


:::

In **Katalon Studio** &gt; **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Katalon TestOps**, there is an option to override authentication.

<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/integration-with-katalon-studio/override-authentication.png" alt="override authentication" />

By default, the **Override authentication** option is disabled, which means the **Server URL** and user credentials to connect with Katalon TestOps are inherited from what has been filled in the **Activation** dialog.

With the **Override authentication** option enabled, you can input a different **Server URL** and user credentials. This information is saved in <code>&lt;project folder&gt;/settings/internal/com.kms.katalon.integration.analytics.properties</code>.

You might need to override authentication when you want to integrate Katalon Studio with Katalon TestOps using a TestOps private instance. To learn more about TestOps private instance offering and how to enable your private instance from Katalon Studio.
