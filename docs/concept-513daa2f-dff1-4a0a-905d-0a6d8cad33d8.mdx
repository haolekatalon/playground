# Testing Mobile Apps using Custom Cloud Devices in Katalon Studio

## Execution

Starting with **Katalon Studio version 6.3.0**, you can test your mobile applications on such custom cloud devices as Sauce Labs, BrowserStack,..

Katalon Studio supports running a Mobile script on both remote and custom cloud devices.

## Mobile Object Spy and Mobile Recorder

Starting with **Katalon Studio version 6.3.0**, *Mobile Object Spy* and *Mobile Recorder* are available on remote devices \(not custom devices\).

### Remote Devices

In addition to Android, iOS and Kobiton devices, a new tool item **Remote Devices** is added to the UI of Mobile Object Spy and Mobile Recorder.

### Configure a remote device

You can configure a remote device in 2 ways:

-   **Project** -&gt; **Settings** -&gt; **Desired Capabilities** -&gt; **Remote** -&gt; Enter the server URL, server type and desired capabilities.

-   Select **Mobile Object Spy**/**Mobile Recorder** -&gt; **Remote Devices**. In the configurations field, click **Edit**. In the pop-up, users can enter the server URL, server type and desired capabilities.


### Enter a Cloud Application ID

**Cloud Application ID** is the ID of the application file \(.apk; .ipa\) after being uploaded to the cloud. The Kobitonâ€™s application ID, for instance, is **kobiton-store:23616**.
