# Manage dynamic test suites in Katalon Studio

A dynamic test suite \(DTS\) is a test suite with multiple test cases added via a search query. You can dynamically add test cases based on the ID, name, tag, comment, and description of a test case.

This article shows you how to create and query test cases for execution in a dynamic test suite.

## Requirements

-   An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license. To learn more about activating your license, you can refer to this document here: [Activate Katalon license](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/activate-a-katalon-license).

## Create a new dynamic test suite

To create a new dynamic test suite, do as follows:

1.  In the **Tests Explorer** panel, right-click at the **Test Suites** folder &gt; **New** &gt; **Dynamic Test Suite**.

2.  Fill in the name and the description \(optional\).

    We name it **Dynamic Test Suite 1**.

3.  Click **OK**.


You have successfully created a new dynamic test suite.

## Add test cases to a dynamic test suite \(version 8.5.0 onwards\)

From version 8.5.0, the built-in search feature for dynamic test suite is available. To add test cases to a dynamic test suite in Katalon Studio version 8.5.0 onwards, follow these steps:

1.  Open a test case, then switch to the **Properties** tab. Add a tag to your test case and save your test case. For example, we add a tag called kami.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Manage_Tests/Dynamic_Test_Suite/manage-dynamic-test-suite-ks/Image/ks-850-add-tag.png" width={800} />

2.  Open a dynamic test suite. In the **Query Provider** section, select **Built-in Search**.

3.  **Query Builder** provides a convenient way to create and run a query in Katalon Studio. To open the **Query Builder** function, in the dynamic test suite view, click on **Query Builder**.

    The **Query Builder** dialog appears with the included information:

    -   **Id**: to search by the exact IDs of a test artifact.
    -   **Name**: to search by the name of a test artifact.
    -   **Tag**: to search by the tag linked to test artifacts.
    -   **Comment**: to search by the comments attached to test artifacts.
    -   **Description**: to search by the description associated with test artifacts.
    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Manage_Tests/Dynamic_Test_Suite/manage-dynamic-test-suite-ks/Image/KS-query-builder-dialog.png" width={500} alt="The query builder dialog" />

    Every field in this **Query Builder** function can be applied to search for all types of test artifacts such as test cases, test suites, folders, etc. However, only test cases will be found and added to the dynamic test suite.

4.  Input your search criteria, then click **Search**. The query provider queries out the matching test cases.

    In this example, we find test case with the kami tag.

## Add test cases to a dynamic test suite \(version 8.4.1 and before\)

To add test cases to a dynamic test suite in Katalon Studio version 8.4.1 and before, you first need to enable the search query provider in Katalon Studio. Follow these steps:

1.  By default, the **Query Provider** is set to **No query provider available** when you implement the dynamic test suite for the first time. To enable the query provider for the dynamic test suite:

    1.  Install one of the following plugins from the Katalon Store:

        -   [Basic search for dynamic test suite](https://store.katalon.com/product/2/Basic-Search-For-Dynamic-Test-Suite)
        -   [Test case management with tags](https://store.katalon.com/product/6/Test-Case-Management-with-Tags)
    2.  Navigate to Account Settings in Katalon Studio and click **Reload Plugin** to activate the installed plugin.

    After you successfully activate the plugin, the **Query Provider** automatically applies the query syntax of the installed plugin. You can learn more about each plugin query syntax in these following documents:

    -   [Query syntax of Basic search for dynamic test suite plugin](/organize/manage-tests/dynamic-test-suite/basic-search-for-dynamic-test-suite)

    -   [Query syntax of Test case management with tags plugin](/organize/manage-tests/dynamic-test-suite/test-case-management-with-tags)

2.  After enabling the search query provider, you can add test cases to the dynamic test suite via the **Query Builder** function.

    **Query Builder** provides a convenient way to create and run a query in Katalon Studio. To open the **Query Builder** function, in the dynamic test suite view, click **Query Builder**.

    The **Query Builder** dialog appears with the included information:

    -   **Id**: to search by the exact IDs of a test artifact.
    -   **Name**: to search by the name of a test artifact.
    -   **Tag**: to search by the tag linked to test artifacts.
    -   **Comment**: to search by the comments attached to test artifacts.
    -   **Description**: to search by the description associated with test artifacts.
    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Manage_Tests/Dynamic_Test_Suite/manage-dynamic-test-suite-ks/Image/KS-query-builder-dialog.png" width={500} alt="The query builder dialog" />

    Every field in this **Query Builder** function can be applied to search for all types of test artifacts such as test cases, test suites, folders, etc. However, only test cases will be found and added to the dynamic test suite.

3.  Input your search criteria, then click **Search**. The query provider queries out the matching test cases.

    In this example, we want to filter for all test cases that have <code>Chrome</code> in their name, and add them into the dynamic test suite. After opening the **Query Builder** dialog, input <code>Chrome</code> into the **Name** text field. Then hit **Search**.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Organize/Manage_Tests/Dynamic_Test_Suite/manage-dynamic-test-suite-ks/Image/KS-test-cases-named-chrome.png" alt="Query test cases whose name contains Chrome" />
