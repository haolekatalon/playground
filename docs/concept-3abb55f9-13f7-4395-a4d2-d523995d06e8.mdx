# Cancel License Renewal

You can cancel your Katalon license subscription at any time. This action will turn off the auto-renewal of your license subscription on the next billing cycle.

Subscription cancellation does NOT issue a refund. You can continue using the remaining subscription you have already purchased.

Only the Account Owner and Admins can cancel a subscription.

After the cancellation, the subscription remains **active** until the end of the current billing period. On the next billing date, its status becomes **terminated**.

To cancel your subscription, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/) and select the desired Account.
2.  Go to **Settings** &gt; **Subscription Management**.
3.  In the **Additional Subscription** section, click on the *option* icon of the license you want to cancel and select **Cancel**.

4.  The subscription cancellation dialog appears. To confirm your action, click **Cancel**.
