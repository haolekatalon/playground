# Override test results status in Katalon TestOps

Automated tests produce test results automatically. This means that test results are fixed unless you manually update the status of a test result to reflect actual expectations.

In Katalon TestOps, you can edit the status of a test result and provide a reason for the change to notify your team of the change.

This feature also allows you to:

-   keep a clear record of why a test result has been changed, who changed it, and the reason for the change.

-   find out whether the status of a test result has been manually modified and what was its initial status.

-   see the whole history of status changes.


## Change the status of a Test Result


:::note

-   Changing the status of a Test Result affects the status of a Test Run and its Test Suite. You should override Test Results statuses with caution. See [TestOps Formulas](/get-started/terminology-and-formulas#) for definitions of **Status \(Test Run\)** and **Status \(Test Suite\)**.


:::

Follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your Project.

2.  Go to **Reports** &gt; **Test Runs**.

3.  Click on a Test Run ID, then select the **Test Results** tab.

    You can see the list of all test results and their details \(Status, ID, Name, Time, Assertions, Links\) here.

4.  Click on the *Extension* icon of the Test Result you want to change.

5.  Click **Mark as Passed** \(for a **failed**/**incomplete**/**error** Test Result\) or **Mark as Failed** \(for a **passed** Test Result\). See [TestOps Formulas](/get-started/terminology-and-formulas#) for definitions of **Status \(Test Result\)**.

    A box pops up asking you to choose a reason for the status change.
