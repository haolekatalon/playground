# Baseline collection

There are two ways a baseline collection is created:

-   If tests are executed in Katalon Studio or run with the CLI as a part of the CI/CD pipeline and their results are uploaded to TestOps, the **System-generated Common Baseline Collection** folder is automatically created to store the captured images.
-   If you schedule test runs in TestOps, you can select **Visual Testing** and choose **Generate a new Baseline Collection**. See: [Schedule Test Runs](/execute/schedule-test-execution/schedule-test-runs-in-testops#).

## Access a baseline collection

To access a baseline collection, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io) and go to your project.

2.  Go to **Visual Testing** &gt; **Visual Baseline Collections**.

    You will see all baseline collection IDs and their details \(latest version, number of the baseline images in each baseline collection, and the test schedule that links to them\).<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-july-visual-testing/kt-visual-baseline-collection-page-ui-jun22.png" width={850} alt="visual baseline collections page" />

3.  Click on the **Baseline Collection ID** you want to check.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/visual-testing-overview/image/all-features.png" width={850} />

    To customize the baseline collection, you can:

    1.  Click on **Pencil** icon to edit the name of the baseline collection.
    2.  Click **History** to see the older version of the baseline collection.
    3.  Edit or delete each baseline image of this baseline collection.
    4.  Select Pixel-based or Layout-based as the default comparison method for the baseline collection.

        
        :::note

        -   This feature is available on Visual Testing Professional \(VTP\) package.
        -   The default comparison method will determine the checkpoint status \(such as **Match** or **Mismatch**\) for all visual test runs that use the same baseline collection.

## Upload baseline images and create new baseline collection

The **Upload baseline images** and **Create new baseline collection** features are available on Visual Testing Professional \(VTP\) package. You can upload images to an existing baseline collection, or create a new baseline collection and upload images to it.

### Upload baseline images

To upload baseline images, after you access an existing baseline collection, follow these steps:

1.  Select the **Baseline Collection ID** that you want to upload images.

    The list of baseline images appears.

2.  Click on **Upload Images** button.

    
    :::note

    -   If you have any unsaved changes \(such as ignored zones, default comparison method, or pixel sensitivity\), you must save them before uploading the image\(s\). Otherwise, the button will be disabled.
