# Test run result details

**Test Results** provides contextual details of a selected test run, including those with failed test cases.

## View test run result details

1.  Go to **Reports** &gt; **Test Runs** &gt; **Test Runs**.

2.  Navigate to the **All Test Runs** section and click a test run ID to go to the selected test run **Summary**.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/View_test_run_results/View_test_run_results_and_execution_logs/Test_run_summary/Image/TO-Reports-select_a_test_run_ID.png" alt="click a test run ID" />

3.  Select **Test Results** and then the test run ID to view details of the test run results: <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/View_test_run_results/View_test_run_results_and_execution_logs/Test_run_detail/Image/TO-Reports-select_tab_Test_Results_.png" alt="select Test Results tab" />

4.  The **Result** page displays detailed information about the test run. In the example below, the selected test run is deemed as **Failed**: <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/View_test_run_results/View_test_run_results_and_execution_logs/Test_run_detail/Image/TO-Reports_Failed_Test_Result.png" alt="Test result page" />

    The **Result** section provides the following contextual information on why your test run achieved a successful \(or failed\) result:

    -   **Error message**: Specific reason why the execution fails.

    -   **Attachments**: Captured screenshots and/or recorded videos to see what went wrong with failed tests.

    -   **Failed Assertions**: When you run tests with Katalon Studio and if you have used [built-in assertion keywords](/create-tests/create-test-cases/generate-test-steps-in-katalon-studio-script-view#) with the <code>verify</code> prefix \(e.g, <code>WebUI.verifyElementPresent</code>\) or [custom assertion keywords](/create-tests/keywords/custom-keywords/introduction-to-custom-keywords-in-katalon-studio) such as <code>KeywordUtil.markPassed(message)</code>, <code>KeywordUtil.markFailed(message)</code>, <code>KeywordUtil.markFailedAndStop(message)</code>, you can see the failed assertions in this section. To know more about assertion in Katalon Studio, see [Assert Statements](/create-tests/create-test-cases/statements/assert-statements).

    -   **Errors**: The full error log. You may download this file.

    -   **Logs**: The execution logs in each test step and the step status. This allows you to quickly troubleshoot which steps cause test failure. You may view this log in text view or tree view.

5.  Navigate to the right side to view more information about your test run result. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/View_test_run_results/View_test_run_results_and_execution_logs/Test_run_detail/Image/TO-Reports_Failed_Test_Result_related_info.png" alt="Test result related information" />This section provides a quick view of the following details in relation to your test run result:

    -   **Test Suite**, **Test Case**: The test suite and test case executed in the test run.

    -   **Similar Failures:** TestOps analyzes all existing failed test results and identifies similar failed test suites or test cases. Those test runs with similar failures are listed in this section with their hyperlinked IDs.

    -   **Failure Reason**: TestOps automatically assigns failure reason to the corresponding top-level exception of failed test results. You may click on the drop-down and change the suggested reason to a different category. You may also click on **Troubleshooting Guideline** for more [information](/maintain/suggested-solutions-for-keyword-errors) on how to resolve your failed test suite and/or test case.
