3.  Select **Screen Recorder** and specify video settings based on your preferences.

    We recommend AVI \(<code>.avi</code>\) format and low quality to save disk space. Higher video quality means bigger file size.

    -   **Video format**: AVI \(<code>.avi</code>\) or MOV \(<code>.mov</code>\).
    -   **Video quality**: Low; Medium or High.
4.  Click **Apply and Close**.
