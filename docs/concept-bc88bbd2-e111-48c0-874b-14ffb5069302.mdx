# \[Mobile\] Install WebDriverAgent for real iOS devices in Katalon Studio

The WebDriverAgent is a WebDriver server used to control iOS devices remotely. It is automatically downloaded with Appium as <code>appium-webdriveragent</code>.

When testing iOS applications with real iOS devices, you need to install WebDriverAgent on your development machine.

In this article, we demonstrate how to install the WebDriverAgent via Katalon built-in tools and manual installation.

## Requirements

-   You have set up real iOS devices for mobile testing with Katalon Studio. See [\[Mobile\] iOS Setup \(Real devices\) in Katalon Studio](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/mobile-testing/ios/mobile-ios-setup-real-devices-in-katalon-studio).

-   You have enrolled in the Apple Developer Program. To learn more about the Apple Developer Program enrollment, you can refer to this Apple document: [Enrollment](https://developer.apple.com/support/enrollment/).

## Install the WebDriverAgent with Katalon built-in tools

From Katalon Studio version 7.2.0 onwards, you can install the WebDriverAgent with Katalon built-in tools. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  Download and install a signing certificate and provisioning profile generated from an Apple Developer Account on your development machine. You can manage your signing assets via Xcode. Refer to the following Apple documents for further information:

    -   [Create, export, and delete signing certificates](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev154b28f09).
    -   [Download manual provisioning profiles](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deva899b4fe5).
2.  Open Katalon Studio and go to **Tools &gt; iOS &gt; Install WebDriverAgent**.

3.  Katalon Studio detects signing certificates available on your Mac. Choose the certificate generated from an Apple Developer Account.

Katalon Studio will build the WebDriverAgent for you.

## Install the WebDriverAgent manually

To install the WebDriverAgent manually, follow these steps:

1.  In **Xcode** &gt; **Preferences** &gt; **Account**, click *Add* \(+\) to enter your Apple Developer Account ID and password.

2.  To navigate to the location of the WebDriverAgent, open **Terminal**, copy and paste the command line argument below:

    ```
    cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent
    
    ```

    For Appium version 1.14.2 or older, copy the following command instead:

    ```
    cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/webdriveragent
    
    ```

3.  After going to the WebDriverAgent location, run the following command to initialize the **WebDriverAgent** project:

    ```
    mkdir -p Resources/WebDriverAgent.bundle
    
    ```

    For Appium version older than 1.20.0, you also need to run the following script on the same terminal:

    ```
    sh ./Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d
    ```

    
    :::note

    -   Error code 13: re-run command with sudo:

        ```
        sudo./Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d
        ```

    -   Error \_Error StackTrace: Cannot find module 'eslint-config-appium': \_missing paramter <code>-d</code> when running <code>/Scripts/bootstrap.sh</code>

    :::

4.  Open **Finder** and type <code>appium-webdriveragent</code> to quickly search for the folder. In the opened folder, double-click the **WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj** file to open it in Xcode.

5.  After opening **WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj** file in Xcode, you need to build the **IntegrationApp** app. To do so, follow these steps:

    1.  Select the **IntegrationApp** target. In the **Signing & Capabilities** section, check the **Automatically manage signing** box, then choose a team added in Step 1.

    You have successfully built the **IntegrationApp** target.

6.  Next, build the **WebDriverAgentLib** target. Follow these steps:

    1.  Select the **WebDriverAgentLib** target. In the **Signing & Capabilities** section, check the **Automatically manage signing** box, then choose a team added in Step 1.

    You have successfully built the **WebDriverAgentLib** target.

7.  Finally, you need to build the **WebDriverAgentRunner** target. Follow these steps:

    1.  Select the **WebDriverAgentRunner** target. In the **Signing & Capabilities** section, check the **Automatically manage signing** box, then choose a team added in Step 1.

        <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/installing-webdriveragent-for-ios-devices/KS-WEBDRIVERAGENT-Confiugre-Runner.png" alt="Configure the WebDriverAgentRunner target" />

    2.  On the menu bar, select **Product** &gt; **Build**.
