# Analytics overview

Besides report features, Katalon Platform also provides analytics features that can help you to extract meaningful insights for improving your test performance. See: [Compare test results in Katalon TestOps](/analyze/analytics/compare-test-results-in-katalon-testops).

Katalon Platform allows you to perform AI image comparison in visual testing, in which you can compare the visible output \(of your tests\) against the baseline image using an AI engine. To learn more about visual testing features, you can refer to this document: [Visual Testing overview](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/visual-testing-overview).
