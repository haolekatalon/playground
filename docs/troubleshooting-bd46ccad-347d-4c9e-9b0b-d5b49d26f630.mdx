# Local Agent doesn't trigger automatically from CMD

When you schedules a test run and starts a local agent, the agent freezes after response with status 200 without running the execution. You have to trigger the execution manually by clicking or pressing enter on the CMD.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Troubleshoot/Troubleshoot_CLI/image/Execution_-_Local_agent_status_200.jpeg" alt="Local agent status 200" />

The issue stems from a new feature of the windows 10 console. Under the default configuration, whenever you click on a command window in windows 10, it immediately pauses the application process when it attempts to write to the console. The command window has gone into "selection" mode because QuickEditMode has been disabled. We need to enable the QuickEdit Mode.

1.  Right-click on the top left bar, then select **Default**.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Troubleshoot/Troubleshoot_CLI/image/select_Defaults.jpeg" alt="select Defaults" />

2.  Select and check on QuickEdit Mode, then select **OK**.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Execute/Troubleshoot/Troubleshoot_CLI/image/enable_QuickEdit_Mode.jpeg" alt="enable QuickEdit Mode" />

3.  Restart the CMD again and start running the execution.
