# Katalon API keys in Katalon Studio

## Use of Katalon API Keys in Katalon Studio

With API Keys generated from **Katalon TestOps**, you can:

-   Install plugins from **Katalon Store** in console mode. See [Use plugins in console mode](/plugins-and-add-ons/katalon-store/katalon-studio-plugins/using-katalon-store-plugins#).
-   Integrate **Katalon Studio** with **Katalon TestOps** in console mode. See Upload Test Results to Katalon TestOps from Katalon Studio.
-   Use API Keys to represent your credentials to integrate **Katalon TestOps** with other platforms like [Jira](/organize/integration-for-organizing-tests/jira-integration/enable-testops-jira-integration-for-test-management) and [Jenkins](/execute/ci-cd-integrations/jenkins-integration/use-katalon-plugins-for-jenkins-integration/integrate-jenkins-with-testops), or to create a test environment with Circle Continous Integration \([CircleCI](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/set-up-circleci-test-environments-for-testops)\), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \([Amazon EKS](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/set-up-kubernetes-test-environments-for-testops)\), or [Local Agent](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/create-a-local-test-environment-with-an-agent).

In the command builder, both command-line options are accepted: <code>-apiKey=&lt;Your&#95;API&#95;Key&gt;</code> and <code>-apikey=&lt;Your&#95;API&#95;Key&gt;</code>.

## Generate Katalon API keys

In **Katalon Studio**, you can view your API Keys in the command builder. To generate, use, and remove an API Key, you need to navigate to the **Katalon API Keys** section in **Katalon TestOps**.
