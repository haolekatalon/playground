#### Add Settings page

Custom Keyword Plugin declares the setting page UI in **katalon-plugin.json** with this sample:

```
{
   "keywords": [],
   "configuration": {
      "settingId": "some id",
      "settingPage": {
         "name": "name",
         "components": [
            {
               "key": "key1",
               "type": "text",
               "label": "My Label 1",
               "defaultValue":"My default value 1"
            },
            {
               "key": "key2",
               "type": "secret",
               "label": "My Label 2"
            }, ...
         ]
      }
   }
}

```

-   **settingId**: id the setting file that stores user setting properties in the setting page. There is a file will generated to store user settings at location:

    ```
    <Project dir>/settings/external/<settingId>.properties
    ```

-   **settingPage** : contains the following sub-properties

    -   **name**: Name of the setting page
    -   **components**: list of UI components

        -   **key**: key of the component
        -   **label**: label of the component
        -   **type**: type of the component \('text' or 'secret'\)
        -   **defaultValue**: default value of the component

#### Prepare to test

       "configuration": {
          "settingId": "com.katalon.plugin.keyword.excel-keywords",
          "settingPage": {
             "name": "Excel Keywords",
             "components": [

                   "type": "text",
                   "label": "Username"
                },
                {
                   "key": "password",
                   "type": "secret",
                   "label": "Password"
                }
             ]
          }
       }
    }
    
    ```

4.  Build excel keyword project <code>gradle katalonPluginPackage</code>

6.  Open **Project A** and navigate to **Project Settings/Plugins/Excel Keywords**

7.  Customize the settings as wish


#### Retrieve the setting values

The values can be retrieved in keyword script as the following sample:

```
import com.kms.katalon.core.configuration.RunConfiguration as RunConfiguration
import com.kms.katalon.core.setting.BundleSettingStore as BundleSettingStore

BundleSettingStore bundleSetting = new BundleSettingStore(RunConfiguration.getProjectDir(), '<setting_id>', true)
