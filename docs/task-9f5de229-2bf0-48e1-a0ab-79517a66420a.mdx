# Enable TestOps private instance integration in Katalon Studio Platform Edition


:::note

-   When running TestOps Private Instance in console mode, you need to activate the KRE license with Private Instance. To do so, pass the Private Instance URL used for authentication to the <code>serverURL</code> parameter. For example: <code>-serverUrl="https://admin-tenant1.katalon-cloudops.com"</code>


:::

1.  Open Katalon Studio - Platform Edition.

    -   If you are opening Katalon Studio Platform Edition for the first time, the **Katalon Studio Activation** dialog automatically pops up.
    -   If you are already logged into a Katalon account in Katalon Studio, then click on the **Profile** button and select **Log out**. Upon logging out, the **Katalon Studio Activation** dialog appears.
