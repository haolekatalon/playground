## Bypass certificate validation in Katalon Studio


:::note

-   Available for Chrome and Firefox.

:::

Katalon Studio supports the capability to bypass certificate validation so that users with protected network policy can work with Katalon Studio as usual. The configuration here applies for Web Service tests.

To configure certificate settings, do as follows:

1.  Go to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Network**.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Network_Settings/certificate-settings/ks-841-certificate-settings.png" width={700} alt="network settings" />

2.  In the **Certificate Settings** section, choose **Bypass certificate validation**.

3.  Click **Apply and Close**.
