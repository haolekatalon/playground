# Capture Windows Objects using the Windows Spy Utility in Katalon Studio

This guide shows you how to capture Windows objects with the Windows spy utility.


:::note

-   Katalon Studio version 7.0 onwards.
-   WinAppDriver is running on the test machine. To learn how to set up and run WinAppDriver, see: [Set up WinAppDriver](/create-tests/manage-projects/set-up-projects/windows-desktop-apps-testing/set-up-winappdriver-in-katalon-studio).

:::

To use the utility, first you need to open the **Spy Windows Objects** dialog. From the main toolbar, click on the **Spy Windows Objects** icon.

## Configure the Windows spy utility

To configure the utility, in the **Configurations** section, specify the following fields:

-   **Configuration**: the WinAppDriver URL and desired capabilities.

-   **Application File**: the absolute path to the Windows executable file \(\*.exe\) of the testing machine. For Windows users, click on the **Browse...** button to locate the application file.


For example, we provide the IP address to the remote Windows machine and the path to Notepad executable as the AUT.

:::note

For Universal Windows Platform \(UWP\) applications, the executable file should be:

-   *ApplicationID*, if the application is published on the Microsoft store.

-   *PackageFamilyName!Application ID*, if the application is still in development.

## Capture Windows objects

To capture Windows objects, follow these steps:

1.  Start the connection to the WinAppDriver by clicking on the **Start** button.

    You can see the opened window of the executed AUT in the **Screen View** section:

    All available objects on the window are displayed in the **All Objects** section. You can verify an object by clicking on it; the utility highlights the object with a green border in **Screen View**.

-   Do not lock the screen of the testing machine

-   Do not run multiple instances of the AUT simultaneously.
