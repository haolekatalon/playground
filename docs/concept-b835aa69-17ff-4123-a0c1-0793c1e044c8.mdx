# Implement data-driven testing with MySQL

From Katalon Studio v8.0.0 onwards, the built-in JDBC driver for MySQL is removed; instead, you can choose to install your preferred version of JDBC driver.

To keep the MySQL database in use, you need to add its driver to the external library for establishing the database connection. To see which libraries Katalon Studio supports built-in JDBC drivers, you can refer to this document: [Introduce database connection](/create-tests/data-driven-testing/configure-database-connection-for-data-driven-testing-in-katalon-studio).

This document shows you how to add a driver for MySQL database connection.

## Add an external JDBC driver for MySQL database connection

-   Katalon Studio version 8.0.0 onwards.

-   You already set up MySQL Database.

-   MySQL Database is running.


1.  Download the MySQL library executable .jar file. You can download from the MySQL website: [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).

    The version of JDBC driver must be compatible with MySQL version.

2.  Go to **Project Settings** &gt; **Library Management**. Click **Add** button to add the jar file to the external library.

3.  In **Project Settings**, switch to **Database** to configure the database connection.

    1.  Select **Secure User and Password** to enable **User** and **Password** fields.

    2.  Input the **User** and **Password** used for authentication.

    3.  Enter **Connection URL**.

    4.  Add **Connection Properties for JDBC Driver** if any \(available from version 8.6.5\).

    5.  Click **Test Connection** to verify whether your database is connected successfully.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Data_Driven_Testing/how-to-implement-ddt-mysql/images/KS-MYSQL-Connect-MySQL.png" width={600} />

4.  Click **Apply and Close** to complete the connection process.
