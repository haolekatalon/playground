# Draft test case

A draft test case is a test case that has been created but has not yet been reviewed or approved publicly in an Organization. It is a work-in-progress and may be subject to changes before it is finalized.

A draft test case is a test case that has been created but has not yet been reviewed or approved publicly in an Organization. It is a work in progress and may be subject to changes before it is finalized. Draft test cases are usually created during the test planning phase and are used to capture initial ideas and thoughts about what needs to be tested. Once the draft test case has been reviewed and approved, it can be further developed, refined, and executed as part of the testing process.

A draft test case is also distinguished from a published test case based on the prefix in the URL \(<code>draft-&#10100;testCaseID-testCaseName&#10101;</code>:

The user accessing the Cloud Studio \(Beta\) Katalon Editor of the same project from different machines can create different draft test cases as Cloud Studio \(Beta\) draft test cases are stored in an indexed database.

Once a draft test case is validated and/or debugged, a draft test case may be published and subsequently moved to a folder as a published test case in Cloud Studio \(Beta\).
