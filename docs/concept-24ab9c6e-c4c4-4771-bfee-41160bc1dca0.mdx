# Introduction to organizing tests

Organizing your tests is a crucial part of your daily testing activities. Since your project may have hundreds or thousands of tests, it is imperative that you organize them efficiently so you can find relevant tests quickly.

In Katalon Platform, you must first upload your test scripts using the Git repositories to Katalon TestOps. See: [Upload test scripts from the Git repository to TestOps](/organize/upload-test-scripts-from-a-git-repository/upload-test-scripts-from-the-git-repository-to-testops).

Once uploading your test scripts from the Git repository, you can organize your tests in Katalon TestOps or Katalon Studio. You can refer to the following documents:

-   [Manage test suites in Katalon TestOps](/organize/manage-tests/test-suite/manage-test-suites-in-katalon-testops)

-   [Manage test suites in Katalon Studio](/organize/manage-tests/test-suite/manage-test-suites-in-katalon-studio)

-   [Manage dynamic test suites in Katalon Studio](/organize/manage-tests/dynamic-test-suite/manage-dynamic-test-suites-in-katalon-studio)


If you want to run parallel tests with multiple browsers, you can add and manage your test suites in a test suite collection. See: [Manage test suite collections in Katalon Studio](/organize/manage-tests/manage-test-suite-collections-in-katalon-studio).

Katalon Platform also supports third-party integration for organizing tests, such as:

-   Jira integration

-   Xray integration

-   qTest integration

-   TestRail integration

-   Azure DevOps Test Plans integration

-   Rally integration

-   TestLink integration
