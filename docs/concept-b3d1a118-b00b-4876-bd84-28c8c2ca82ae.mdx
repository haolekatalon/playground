# Parameterize Mobile Test Object Properties in Katalon Studio


:::note

-   Parameterizing Mobile Test Object Properties is only available with the **Attributes** Selection Method.


:::

The benefits of parameterizing mobile test objects are similar to those of parameterizing web test objects. Refer to [this document](/create-tests/test-objects/web-test-objects/parameterize-web-test-objects-in-katalon-studio) for further details.

## Usage Example

Below is an example of how to parameterize test objects in Mobile testing. Open a sample project of Mobile testing on Android devices by accessing **File&gt; New Sample Project&gt; Sample Android Mobile Tests Project**.

Navigate to **Object Repository/Application/android.widget.TextView - App** in Tests Explorer, open the test object view of <code>android.widget.TextView - App</code> whose property will be parameterized.

In this example, we want to find a test object that has <code>//&lt;[(text() = 'demokatalon' or . = 'demokatalon')]</code> as its selector. Here are the steps to apply this feature:

### Step 1: Parameterize the test object's dynamic property

Create a property with its value as a variable having this syntax: <code>$&#10100;Variable&#95;name&#10101;</code>. For this example, in the **Object's Properties** panel, add an object's property with:

-   Name: <code>text</code>
-   Value: <code>$&#10100;text&#10101;</code>

Its selected locator is generated as

```
//*[(text() =
            '${text}' or . = '${text}')]
```

and identified at runtime with passing data.

### Step 2: Use the parameterized test object in a test case

-   **In Manual View**

    In the <code>Verify Correct Alarm Message</code> test case, double-click the test object that contains the parameterized property, which is <code>android.widget.TextView - App</code>. The **Test Object Input** dialog is displayed.

    In the **Variables** panel, add a new variable with the following properties:

    -   Param Type: the variable type \(The default type is String\).
    -   Param: the variable name of the property created in step 1.
    -   Value Type: the type of the variable's value.
    -   Value: a specific value of that variable.

-   **In Script View**

    You can also switch to the **Scripting Mode** of the current Test Case to adjust the property's value at any time. The predefined variable is automatically mapped when you select a mobile object from manual mode, so you don't need to define them again manually.


### Step 3: Call the findTestObject method within a keyword

In this example, the <code>tap</code> keyword is performed on the object with the text value that we have just specified.

```
groovy
            Mobile.tap(findTestObject('Application/android.widget.TextView -
            App', [('text') : 'demokatalon']), 10)
```

## Escaping special characters

To use a special character like <code>$</code> or <code>\</code> as a regular one in any place that uses parameterized test objects, prepend it with a backslash: <code>\</code> \(the so-called escape character\).

```
{
    "productName": ${GlobalVariable.productName},
    "unit": "\\bottle\",
    "quantity": 50,
    "discount": ${ if (productName == "wine") { return 30 } else { return 0}}
    "note": "Currency unit of ${GlobalVariable.productName} is \$."

}

```

-   Without <code>\</code>: *note: Currency unit of $\{GlobalVariable.productName\} is $*.
-   With <code>\</code>: *note: Currency unit of wine is $*.
