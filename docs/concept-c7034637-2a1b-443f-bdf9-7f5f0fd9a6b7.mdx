# Create your first automation script in Katalon Recorder

Broadly speaking, there are usually two steps to create an automate scenario in Katalon Recorder: 1. Add commands to interact with websites 2. Add verify or assert commands to make sure your test case follows the correct flow.

## Add commands to interact with websites

To get started, use the Recorder to automatically create a test case:

-   Click on the **Record** button.

-   Switch to the currently active tab.

-   Start interacting with your website.

-   Switch to Katalon Recorder.

-   Click the **Stop** button.


You should see your interactions are recorded as a test case.

## Add verify or assert commands

There are two ways to add verify or assert commands.

### After the recording of a test case

If you just have just recorded a test case:

-   Add a new test step through the toolbar item.

-   Type <code>verify</code> or <code>assert</code> in the Command field of the new test step.

-   Choose from the list of available suggested commands \(for example <code>verifyElementPresent</code>\).

-   Click on the button **Select a target element for the current command** located next to the Target field of the new test step.

-   Switch to the currently active tab.

-   Select an element on the page.

-   Switch back to Katalon Recorder.


You should see the newly created assert or verify command for the target element.

### During the recording of a test case

If you are recording a test case:

-   Right-click on the target element.

-   Choose a command from the context menu item *Katalon Recorder \(Selenium tests generator\)*.
