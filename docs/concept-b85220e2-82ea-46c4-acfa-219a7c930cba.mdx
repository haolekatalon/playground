# Authorization in Katalon Studio

APIs use authorization to make sure that client requests access data securely. Authorization involves authenticating and confirming that the sender of a request have the permission to access or manipulate the relevant data.

You can add your authorization information the **Authorization** tab of a **Web Service Request**.
