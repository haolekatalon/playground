# Use the Command-Line Runner in Katalon Recorder

## Use the Command-Line Runner in Katalon Recorder

## Using KR CLI as a tester

If you are a tester, you can integrate KR tests into the CI/CD pipeline to execute them at specific time intervals, or by defining custom triggers.

### Executing a test suite

1.  Copy the following command:

    ```
    kr-cli run <browser> <pathToHtmlFile> --report=<pathToReportFolder>
    ```

2.  Replace:

    -   <code>pathToHtmlFile</code> with the absolute path to your KR test suite.

    -   <code>browser</code> with either chrome or firefox.

    -   <code>pathToReportFolder</code> with the absolute path to an existing folder

3.  Execute the command.

After executing the command, a report file with a .csv extension and a log file with a .log extension will be generated at the specified report folder.

### Executing a test suite with data files

1.  Copy the following command:

    ```
    kr-cli run <browser> <pathToHtmlFile> --report=<pathToReportFolder> --data=<pathToData1>
    ```

2.  Replace:

    -   <code>pathToHtmlFile</code> with the absolute path to your KR test suite.

    -   <code>browser</code> with either chrome or firefox.

    -   <code>pathToReportFolder</code> with the aboluste path to an existing folder.

    -   <code>pathToData1</code> with the absolute path to your data file.

3.  Execute the command.

If your test suite uses multiple data files, separate the paths with a comma.

A report file with a .csv extension and a log file with a .log extension will be generated at the specified report folder.

## Using KR CLI as a developer

If you are a developer, you can integrate KR tests into your development process to ensure that your code doesn't break important user experiences.

### Executing all test suites in a project

1.  Place all KR test suites under folder /tests/kr-test in your NodeJS project.

2.  Copy the following command:

    <code>kr-cli dev &lt;browser&gt; --lg</code>

3.  Replace browser with chrome or firefox.

4.  Execute the command.



:::note

-   By default, no report or log files are generated when running commands in development mode. Instead, An overview of test execution will be printed directly to your command line tool.

-   Specify --lg to print the logs to your command line tool during test execution.
