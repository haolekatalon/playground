# Binary Statements

A Binary statement represents a dual expression consisting of two single **expressions** \(variables, strings, numbers, methods...\) and an operator, for example: +, -, \*, &lt;, &lt;=, !, etc.\). For more details about using operators in Groovy, refer to this Groovy documentation: [Operators](http://groovy-lang.org/operators.html).


:::note

-   Once a test step is added as any of the control statements, it is not allowed to change into another keyword.

## In manual view

1.  Open a test case in **Manual** view. Click on the drop-down icon of the **Add** button, then choose **Binary Statements**.

2.  To add a keyword under a statement, select that statement, then click **Add**. A test step is created under that statement.

    A test step representing a binary statement is added to the test case.

3.  Double-click on the **Input** cell to edit those required components.

    Binary statements are normally used to assign either values to test objects

    or test objects to variables to take the next steps.

4.  Save the test case when you're done.

## In script view

### In Script view

The **Script** view of a test case allows you to programmatically define and handle binary statements using Groovy or Java languages.

For example :

-   To assign a value to a test object

    ```
    myText = 'Welcome to Katalon Studio'
    ```

-   To assign a test object to a variable

    ```
    myObject = findTestObject('my object') WebUI.setText(myObject, 'Welcome to Katalon Studio') WebUI.verifyTextPresent('Welcome to Katalon Studio', false)
    ```
