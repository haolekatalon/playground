When you encounter the following exception: <code>com.kms.katalon.core.webui.exception.WebElementNotFoundException: Web element with id ... not found.</code>

There are two possible causes:

This can be caused by incorrect XPath locators.

2.  Right-click on your desired test object and select **Inspect**.

3.  In the **Elements** tab of **DevTool**, right-click on your target object and select **Copy** &gt; **Copy XPath**.

4.  Open your test object in Katalon Studio and update your XPath property with the copied value.
