# Use TestOps Visual Testing

You can compare images captured during test executions with TestOps Visual Testing.

## Set up Visual Testing

To set up Visual Testing, follows these steps:

1.  Enable screenshot capture in Katalon Studio. See [Capture Screenshots](/analyze/reports/view-test-reports/view-test-reports-in-katalon-studio/view-captured-screenshots-in-katalon-studio-reports).

    
    :::note

    -   You can only apply visual testing for screenshots taken as checkpoints. For new users, we highly recommend using[\[WebUI\] Take Screenshot As Checkpoint](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/visual-based-web-testing-keywords/webui-take-screenshot-as-checkpoint) these keywords:

        -   [\[WebUI\] Take Screenshot As Checkpoint](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/visual-based-web-testing-keywords/webui-take-screenshot-as-checkpoint)
        -   [\[Mobile\] Take Screenshot As Checkpoint](/create-tests/keywords/keyword-description-in-katalon-studio/visual-based-mobile-testing-keywords/mobile-take-screenshot-as-checkpoint)
    -   You can also use this [Visual testing sample project](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/testops-visual-testing-sample) on Katalon Studio for basic setup. To learn more about using the WebUI sample project, see: [Sample WebUI tests project](/get-started/sample-projects/webui/sample-webui-tests-project-healthcare-sample-in-katalon-studio).

    :::

2.  Run a test suite in Katalon Studio.

    
    :::note

    -   If you have enabled Katalon Studio Integration, Katalon Studio automatically uploads Test Results to Katalon TestOps.

    :::

3.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your project.

4.  Go to **Visual Testing** &gt; **Visual Test Runs**.

5.  Click on the ID of a Visual Test Run.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/ks-visual-testing/image/kte-jul2022-visual_test-run-results-page.png" alt="visual test run results page" />

    The **Results** page appears. You can see the screenshots \(known as **Visual Checkpoints**\) captured during a test execution.

6.  Select one of the screenshots to see the details.

    -   If you run a Test Suite for the first time, there is no baseline image.

    -   If you have existing visual data, it is stored in the **System-generated baseline collection** folder.


You have successfully set up Visual Testing in Katalon TestOps.

## Configure a baseline image

You can set up a baseline image to compare it with the screenshot of the next Test Run. Follow these steps:

1.  Select a screenshot to see the details.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/ks-visual-testing/image/kte-jul2022-screenshot-page.png" alt="visual checkpoint passed status" />

2.  Select **Mark as Passed** at the top right corner of a screenshot, then close the screenshot.

    An *Unsaved* label now appears on the **Results** page.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/ks-visual-testing/image/kte-jul2022-visual-test-run-results-page-with-unsaved-label.png" alt="unsaved label on results page" />

3.  Click **Save to baseline**.

    
    :::note

    -   If you run a Test Suite for the first time and the Test Suite has passed, the screenshots are automatically marked as **Passed** and there is no **Save to baseline** button. You can open a screenshot and click **Failed**, then switch back to **Passed** so that the **Save to baseline** button appears.

    :::


## Access a baseline collection

To access a baseline collection, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io) and go to your project.

2.  Go to **Visual Testing** &gt; **Visual Baseline Collections**.

    You will see all baseline collection IDs and their details \(latest version, number of the baseline images in each baseline collection, and the test schedule that links to them\).<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-july-visual-testing/kt-visual-baseline-collection-page-ui-jun22.png" width={850} alt="visual baseline collections page" />

3.  Click on the **Baseline Collection ID** you want to check.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/visual-testing-overview/image/all-features.png" width={850} />

    To customize the baseline collection, you can:

    1.  Click on **Pencil** icon to edit the name of the baseline collection.
    2.  Click **History** to see the older version of the baseline collection.
    3.  Edit or delete each baseline image of this baseline collection.
    4.  Select Pixel-based or Layout-based as the default comparison method for the baseline collection.

        
        :::note

        -   This feature is available on Visual Testing Professional \(VTP\) package.
        -   The default comparison method will determine the checkpoint status \(such as **Match** or **Mismatch**\) for all visual test runs that use the same baseline collection.
        :::


## Unresolved images

If you run the Test Suite again and the new screenshots of this test execution are different from the baseline images, the status of this Visual Test Run is then marked as **Unresolved**. To resolve these images, follow these steps:

1.  Click on the ID of the unresolved Visual Test Run.

2.  Select the unresolved checkpoint.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-july-visual-testing/kt-visual-testing-pixel-ui-may2022.png" alt="mismatch image comparison method box" />

    You see a drop-down list in the **Comparison Method** section. The three options include: **Pixel**, **Layout**, **Text Content**. For detailed information of each comparison method, see: [TestOps Visual Testing](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/visual-testing-overview#).

3.  Select one of the three options to start comparing the new screenshot \(on the right\) with the baseline image \(on the left\).

    
    :::note

    -   **Comparison Method** is enabled only if the status of the screenshot is **mismatched**.
    :::

    -   If you select **Pixel**, check the **Diffs** between two images \(the differences are highlighted in red\). See: [Pixel-based comparison](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/visual-testing-overview#).
    -   If you select **Layout**, check the **Identical**, **Distinguishable** and **Missing/New** boxes to see the differences highlighted in green/red/pink color respectively. See: [Layout-based comparison](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/visual-testing-overview#).
    -   If you select **Text Content**, check the **Identical**, **Shifted** and **Missing/New** boxes to see the differences highlighted in green/blue/pink color respectively. See: [Content-based comparison](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/visual-testing-overview#).
4.  Click **Mark as Passed** or **Mark as Failed** to resolve.

    
    :::note

    -   The **Unsaved** label appears whenever you change the status \(**Passed** or **Failed**\) of a screenshot. If you click **Save to baseline**, the new **Passed** screenshot replace the older baseline image. Katalon TestOps then compares between the new baseline image and screenshots of the next Visual Test Run.

## Ignored zones

Specifying ignored zones is especially useful when testing a website with some dynamic and changing content \(such as pop-up ads on specific areas\). Visual testing can ignore such content while comparing captured images with the baseline one.

In TestOps Visual Testing, you can configure an ignore zone in a baseline image and apply this ignored zone to all baseline images in the baseline collection. You can also delete the ignored zone\(s\) in all baseline images.

### Add an ignored zone to a baseline image

To configure an ignored zone, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io) and go to your project.

2.  Go to **Visual Testing** &gt; **Visual Baseline Collections**.

3.  Select the **Baseline Collection ID** you want to check.

    The list of baseline images appears.



4.  Click on the **Edit image** icon of the baseline image you want to configure \(e.g., the baseline image **image10**\).

    The page displays as below.<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-july-visual-testing/kt-edit-baseline-image10-ui-jun22.png" alt="configure ignored zone in image10" />

5.  Click on the **Configure Ignored Zones** button.

    The button is then highlighted in blue, which indicates the edit mode.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-july-visual-testing/kt-configure-ignored-zones-button-in-blue-ui-jun22.png" alt="configure ignored zones button highlighted" />

6.  Draw \(in rectangles\) to specify the area you want to ignore.

    The ignored zones are highlighted in purple. You can draw up to 20 ignored zones \(i.e. 20 rectangles\).

    
    :::note

    -   If you want to apply an ignored zone to all baseline images, see: [Apply an ignored zone to all baseline images](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/use-testops-visual-testing#).

    :::

7.  Click **Save**.

    You have temporarily saved the ignored zones on this baseline image.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-july-visual-testing/kt-ignored-zone-in-purple-ui-jun22.png" alt="save baseline image10" />

    
    :::note

    -   You have not permanently saved the configuration of ignored zones at this stage.
    :::

8.  Click **Save Changes** on the top right corner to permanently save the ignored zones you have configured.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-revamp-july-visual-testing/kt-save-changes-button-enabled-ui-jun22.png" alt="save changes button for baseline collection" />


The baseline image has now had ignored zones. Visual testing then ignores these zones when comparing captured images with this baseline image.

When comparing the checkpoint image with the baseline image, you can show or hide the ignored zones by ticking/un-ticking the **Ignored Zones** checkbox.

### Apply an ignored zone to all baseline images

Adding an ignored zone to the same area in multiple baseline images could become time-consuming if there are more than one baseline image. With TestOps Visual Testing, you can apply an ignored zone to multiple baseline images in a baseline collection.

To apply an ignored zone to all baseline images within one baseline collection, follow these steps:

1.  Configure an ignored zone. See: [Add an ignored zone to a baseline image](/analyze/analytics/visual-testing/use-testops-visual-testing#).

    The ignored zone is displayed in purple.

2.  Click on the ignored zone, then select the **Apply the zone to all images** icon.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/ks-visual-testing/image/kte-jul2022-apply-zone-to-all-icon.png" alt="apply ignored zone to all images icon" />

    You then see the **Acknowledgement** pop-up box.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/ks-visual-testing/image/kte-jul2022-acknowledgement-box.png" alt="ignored-zone-acknowledgement-popup" />

3.  Click **Acknowledge**.

    The ignored zone is now displayed in yellow because it has been applied to all other baseline images in the baseline collection.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/ks-visual-testing/image/kte-jul2022-ignored-zone-applied-to-all.png" alt="ignored zone applied to all images" />

4.  Click **Save** to temporarily save the configuration.

5.  Click **Save Changes** on the top right corner to permanently save the configuration.


You have applied an ignored zone to all baseline images within the selected baseline collection.

### Delete ignored zones

You can delete an ignored zone in one baseline image and/or all baseline images in the baseline collection.

An ignored zone applied to one baseline image only is displayed in purple. To delete it, click on the ignored zone and select the **Delete ignored zone** icon.

An ignored zone applied to all baseline images is displayed in yellow. To delete it, follow these steps:

1.  Click on the ignored zone and select the **Delete ignored zone** icon.

    <img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/ks-visual-testing/image/kte-jul2022-delete-ignored-zone-icon.png" alt="delete ignored zone icon" />

    The **Delete all ignored zones** box pops up.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Analytics/Visual_testing/ks-visual-testing/image/kte-jul2022-delete-all-ignored-zone-popup.png" alt="delete all ignored zones popup box" />

2.  Click **Delete all zones** to confirm your action.

3.  Click **Save** to temporarily save the configuration.

4.  Click **Save Changes** to permanently save this configuration.

    The ignored zone is now deleted in all baseline images of the baseline collection.
