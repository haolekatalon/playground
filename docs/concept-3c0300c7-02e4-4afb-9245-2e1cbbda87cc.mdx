# Install Katalon Studio for Linux \(GUI\)

Linux is an open-source operating system with many distributions. If you are a Linux user or you want to test your build in a Linux environment, you can still enjoy Katalon Studio with a GUI on your Linux. You can also run your test in console mode with Katalon Runtime Engine for Linux.

Katalon Studio for Linux is compatible with any latest version of Linux distribution that supports Gnome, KDE, or Unity Desktop Environment. You can find links to popular distribution download pages at [Linux.org](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/). Our Katalon team has tested Katalon Studio for Linux on Ubuntu Linux. See the Ubuntu manual for additional information on how to install Linux Ubuntu: [Installation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation).

This guide covers setting up steps for running Katalon Studio GUI on Linux.


:::tip

-   You can install Linux with a LiveDVD, USB drive, or physical disk to a Virtual Machine. Before installing Linux, take a look at the [System Requirements](http://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/System+Requirements) to operate with Katalon Studio.
-   On macOS, virtualization programs like Parallels Desktop, Virtual Box, and VMWare Fusion allow you to construct a Virtual Machine that emulates the hardware of a Linux operating system. Microsoft's Hyper-V is a good option for Windows. To learn more about these virtualization programs, see Parallels Desktop documentation [Parallels Desktop for Mac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/resources/), Virtual Box documentation [About VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox), WMWare documentation [Creating a Linux Virtual Machine in Fusion](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Fusion/12/com.vmware.fusion.using.doc/GUID-4919245A-CD5D-4FC7-B5D0-4D90DFAFC7F7.html), or Microsoft documentation [Hyper-V on Windows Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-on-windows-server).

## Katalon Studio environment requirements for Linux

Before installing Katalon Studio for Linux, you need to set up your environment. Follow these steps:

1.  Verify whether your computer meets the system requirements to work with Katalon Studio. You need to make sure that there is a minimum of 2 GB RAM \(32-bit\) or 4 GB RAM \(64-bit\) for the app to run normally. For more details, see [System Requirements](http://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/System+Requirements).

    
    :::note

    -   From Katalon Studio version 7.9.1 onwards, we only support 64-bit Windows, macOS, and Linux.

    :::

2.  Install OpenJDK 8 \(NOT Oracle JDK\).

    
    :::note

    -   Katalon Studio for Linux currently supports OpenJDK 8 only.

    :::

    To install OpenJDK 8 on your Ubuntu, open your Terminal. On the command line, type:

    ```
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
    ```

    Once you finish the installation, your <code>OpenJDK</code> information is displayed when you execute <code>java -version</code> command.

    If you have multiple versions of OpenJDK installed on your Ubuntu and the correct version is not being used, use the alternatives command to switch between them:

    ```
    sudo update-alternatives --config java //then choose the openjdk-8-jre option
    ```

    Verify the version of the JDK again using <code>java -version</code> command.

    
    :::note

    -   After you have finished configuring the system, restart for your changes to take effect.

    :::

    You can find more information about the installation steps for other Linux distributions at the OpenJDK document: [How to download and install prebuilt OpenJDK packages.](http://openjdk.java.net/install/)


You might encounter the <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> error since Oracle JDK is being used. To resolve this error, do as follows:

1.  Uninstall Oracle JDK.

2.  Install [OpenJDK 8.](http://openjdk.java.net/install/)

## Start Katalon Studio in Linux

After downloading Katalon Studio \(KS\), you can start KS in Linux. Do as follows:

    In the extracted folder, you can find the Katalon Studio app.

2.  Open Katalon Studio by double-clicking on Katalon Studio, or run <code>cd ./katalon</code> in your Terminal.
