#### Grid Hub

To start Katalium Server as a Grid Hub, execute <code>hub.sh</code> file \(in macOS and Linux\) or <code>hub.bat</code> file \(in Windows\) with these commands:

```
cd katalium-server
hub.bat

```

```
cd katalium-server
chmod u+x ./hub.sh
./hub.sh

```

See **Standalone mode** for activation steps.

#### Grid Node

Before executing the scripts, please set the Hub URL in <code>nodeConfigForWindow.json</code> \(for Windows\) or <code>nodeConfig.json</code> \(for macOS and Linux\) so that Grid Nodes can register themselves with the above Grid Hub, e.g. <code>http://hub&#95;ip:4444</code>.

To start Katalium Server as a Grid Node, execute <code>node.sh</code> file \(in macOS and Linux\) or <code>node.bat</code> file \(in Windows\).

```
cd katalium-server
node.bat

```

```
cd katalium-server
chmod u+x ./node.sh
./node.sh

```

See **Standalone mode** for activation steps.
