## Setting timeout

In the previous Katalon Studio's versions, users may have encountered the timeout exception during recording a Desktop application and executing a Windows test. To address this issue, from version **7.5.5**, Katalon Studio increases the default timeout for finding a Windows title from 60 to 120 seconds when recording and executing tests.

Additionally, users are allowed to change this default timeout value when using the keyword for executing tests via Script \(in milliseconds\) to make sure the WinAppDriver has enough time to perform the action.

```
import com.kms.katalon.core.windows.keyword.helper.WindowsActionSettings

'Change the default timeout for finding a Windows title to 180000 milliseconds'
WindowsActionSettings.DF_WAIT_ACTION_TIMEOUT_IN_MILLIS = 180000;

```
