# SOAP Request in Katalon Studio

When sending a SOAP Request in Katalon Studio, you can receive a response from the API server for examination and troubleshooting. This section includes a tutorial of how to create a SOAP request object and an introduction to each field of a request service in its opened editor.

## Creating a SOAP-based Request

1.  From the main menu, select **File &gt; New &gt; Web Service Request**.
2.  In the **New Web Service Request** dialog, select **SOAP** in the **Request Type** list and click **OK** to create a new SOAP object.

3.  A **New** request object is created under the **Object Repository** of Katalon Studio.


## Adding SOAP Request Details

After you've created a request successfully, double-click on the request to open its editor for adding details. In the opened editor of the **New Request** object, you can see all the required information of a request object.
