# Set desired execution behaviors of Katalon Studio

Execution settings help define the desired behaviors of Katalon Studio during test execution. To access default **Execution Settings** of a project in Katalon Studio, from the main menu, select **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Execution**.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Execution_Settings/image/ks-840-execution-settings.png" alt="Execution Settings" />

You can see the following information in the execution settings:

-   **Default execution**: The default environment that Katalon Studio uses for executing test scripts.
-   **Log executed test steps**: Decide whether the logs include executed test steps or not. [Learn more](/analyze/reports/view-test-reports/view-test-reports-in-katalon-studio/view-and-customize-execution-log-in-katalon-studio#).
-   **Default wait for element timeout \(in seconds\)**: The default timeout period that Katalon Studio waits for the application under test to be loaded when executing the automation test.
-   **Post-Execution Options**: These options decide the actions that Katalon Studio performs after finishing test execution.

    -   **Open report**: Specify whether the report generated after your test suite's execution finishes is to be opened immediately.
    -   **Terminate drivers**: Specify when any driver remains after execution is terminated.

Under the execution settings, you can also configure:

-   Launch Arguments
-   Web UI

-   Web Sevice

## Allow editing JVM parameters in Execution Settings


:::note

-   Katalon Studio version 7.2.5 onwards

-   An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license. To learn more about types of licenses, you can refer to this document: [Types of licenses.](/administer/katalon-studio-enterprise-and-katalon-runtime-engine-license/license-overview)

:::

You can edit VM arguments in the execution settings by going to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Execution** &gt; **Launch Arguments**.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Execution_Settings/image/ks-855-launch-arguments.png" width={600} />

In the **VM Arguments** tab, enter your arguments. VM Arguments entered in the executions settings of a project change the behavior of a Java process of each execution. For example:

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Execution_Settings/image/ks-855-launch-arg-example.png" width={600} />

To make sure if the configuration works, add this simple test case:

```
import com.kms.katalon.core.util.KeywordUtil
KeywordUtil.logInfo(System.getProperty("testme")) 
```

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Execution_Settings/image/ks-855-vm-example-tc.png" width={700} />

Currently, Katalon Studio does not support VM arguments values containing space. Below is a list of the most used JVM Parameters:

Specify minimal and maximal heap sizes:

-   <code>-Xms&lt;heap size&gt;[unit]</code>
-   <code>-Xmx&lt;heap size&gt;[unit]</code>
-   <code>-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=&lt;metaspace size&gt;[unit]</code>

Garbage collection implementation types:

-   Serial Garbage Collector: <code>-XX:+UseSerialGC</code>
-   Parallel Garbage Collector: <code>-XX:+UseParallelGC</code>
-   CMS Garbage Collector: <code>-XX:+USeParNewGC</code>
-   G1 Garbage Collector: <code>-XX:+UseG1GC</code>

Garbage collection logging:

-   Specify the log file rolling policy: <code>-XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation</code>

-   Denote the max number of log files that can be written for a single application life cycle: <code>-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=&lt; number of log files &gt;</code>

-   Specify the max size of the file: <code>-XX:GCLogFileSize=&lt; file size &gt;[ unit ]</code>

-   Denote the file's location: <code>-Xloggc:/path/to/gc.log</code>


Handling out of memory:

-   Dump heap into physical file in case of OutOfMemoryError: <code>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</code>
-   Denote the path where the file is to be written: <code>-XX:HeapDumpPath=./java&#95;pid&lt;pid&gt;.hprof</code>
-   Issue emergency commands to be executed in case of out of memory error: <code>-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="&lt; cmd args &gt;;&lt; cmd args &gt;"</code>

-   Limits the proportion of the VM's time that is spent in GC before an OutOfMemory error is thrown: <code>-XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit</code>


## WebUI settings

You can set default settings for Web UI test execution by going to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Execution** &gt; **WebUI**.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Execution_Settings/image/ks-855-webui.png" width={700} />

These settings decide Katalon Studio behaviors when executing WebUI test in a project.

-   **Default Smart Wait**: Tell the web driver to wait for the web page to become static before any operations are performed. [Learn more](/create-tests/record-and-spy/webui-record-and-spy-utilities/smart-wait-function).
-   **Default wait when IE hangs**: Specify Katalon Studio default waiting time when IE hangs.
-   **Default page load timeout**:

    -   **Wait until the page is loaded**: Katalon Studio waits for the web page to load completely.
    -   **Wait for \(in seconds\)**: The default timeout period \(in seconds\) that Katalon Studio waits for the web page to load.
-   **Delay between actions**: The time for Katalon Studio to wait between test steps when executing test cases.

    -   **in seconds**: This option is selected by default.
    -   **in milliseconds**: This option is supported in Katalon Studio version 7.3 onwards.

## Web Service settings


:::note

-   Katalon Studio version 7.6.0 onwards

-   An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license

:::

You can set default settings for Web Service test execution by going to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Execution** &gt; **Web Service**. The following global configurations are applied to both RESTful and SOAP requests in a project.

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Create_tests/Manage_Projects/Project_Settings/Execution_Settings/image/ks-855-ws.png" width={700} />

-   **Connection Timeout in milliseconds \(0=unlimited\)**: The time to establish the connection with the remote server. When it is set to 0 or left empty, Katalon waits for a response forever.

-   **Socket Timeout in milliseconds \(0=unlimited\)**: The time waiting for data – after establishing the connection.

-   **Max Response size in bytes**: The maximum number of bytes Katalon Studio renders from a response. When it is set to 0 or left empty, Katalon Studio downloads a response regardless of its size. Please note that downloading a large response may affect the application's performance.


For your convenience, we provide a shortcut to these global settings in a test request view.

## Web Service settings in script view


:::note

-   Katalon Studio version 7.6.0 onwards.

-   An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license

:::

You can set request timeout and maximum response size via a script using the built-in functions of Katalon Studio.

### Request timeout

-   Override timeout settings of a project in a test case

    ```
    Map<String, Object> generalSettings = RunConfiguration.getExecutionGeneralProperties()
    generalSettings.put(RunConfiguration.REQUEST_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, 3500)
    generalSettings.put(RunConfiguration.REQUEST_SOCKET_TIMEOUT, 3500)
    ```

-   Change timeout settings of a specific test request

    ```
    RequestObject request = findTestObject("Object Repository/Localhost") request.setConnectionTimeout(3500) request.setSocketTimeout(3500)
     
    // Or to unset the timeout request.setConnectionTimeout(RequestObject.TIMEOUT_UNSET) request.setSocketTimeout(RequestObject.TIMEOUT_UNSET) 
    
    // Or to set the timeout to unlimited request.setConnectionTimeout(RequestObject.TIMEOUT_UNLIMITED) request.setSocketTimeout(RequestObject.TIMEOUT_UNLIMITED) 
    // Or if you just want to set to its default value (The default value is set to unlimited) request.setConnectionTimeout(RequestObject.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT) request.setSocketTimeout(RequestObject.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)
    ```


### Maximum response time


:::note

-   Katalon Studio also supports setting the maximum response size of execution using <code>-maxResponseSize</code> in the command line. [Learn more.](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/command-line-syntax-in-katalon-runtime-engine#)


:::

-   Override response size limit of a project in a test case

    ```
    Map<String, Object> generalSettings = RunConfiguration.getExecutionGeneralProperties()
    generalSettings.put(RunConfiguration.REQUEST_MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE, 400)
    ```

-   Change maximum response size setting of a specific test request

    ```
    RequestObject request = findTestObject("Object Repository/Basic Auth")
    request.setMaxResponseSize(400) 
    
    // Or to unset response size limit. And so, the project's max response size setting will be used.
    request.setMaxResponseSize(RequestObject.MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_UNSET) 
    
    // Or to set response size limit to unlimited
    request.setMaxResponseSize(RequestObject.MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_UNLIMITED) 
    
    // Or if you just want to set to its default value (The default value is set to unlimited)
    request.setMaxResponseSize(RequestObject.DEFAULT_MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE)
    ```
