# Test Execution Overview

Katalon Platform offers a variety of test execution solutions, giving testers the flexibility of choosing the execution environments and behaviors. This document is an overview of test execution methods offered by Katalon Platform and their common use cases.

## Test methods

Katalon Platform provides scalable test executing solutions across local, on-premises, and cloud environments. Specifically, the platform offers the following methods.

-   **Local**: You can develop and execute your tests right away with Katalon Studio or with the command-line interface of Katalon Runtime Engine \(KRE\). See: [Execute tests with Katalon Studio overview](/execute/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio-overview) and [Execute tests with KRE](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/get-started-with-katalon-runtime-engine#).

-   **Cloud-based**: With TestOps and TestCloud, you can execute tests on most common browsers and operating systems, and on different devices specific to your application under test. See: [Test Execution with TestOps](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/test-execution-with-testops) and [Use TestCloud in TestOps](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testcloud/use-testcloud-in-testops).

-   **CI/CD Integrations**: We provide a pre-configured Docker image equipped with KRE - the Katalon Docker Image \(KDI\). With this image, you can implement test executions in containers of any CI/CD pipeline. See: [CI/CD Integration Overview](/execute/ci-cd-integrations/ci-cd-integration-overview).


## Integrations with other vendors for cloud execution

Besides the provided methods, you can further extend Katalon tools by integrating with other software testing vendors. These integrations allow you to execute Katalon tests in cloud environments and devices created by other platforms, for web or mobile applications.

The integrations for test execution include:

## Use Cases

The following are some common use cases for test executions in Katalon Platform.

-   Record and replay your tests in Katalon Studio to validate basic test cases. See: [Execute a test case](/execute/execute-tests-with-katalon-studio/execute-a-test-case).

-   Pass your Katalon test projects to KRE and execute the tests in your development environment with headless mode. See: [Command Builder in Katalon Studio](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/get-started-with-katalon-runtime-engine#).

-   Self-host a local **TestOps** agent that contains KRE and execute tests. See: [Create a Local Test Environment with an Agent](/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/create-a-local-test-environment-with-an-agent).

-   Map your **TestOps** project with a test repository \(hosted on GitHub, GitLab, ...\) and schedule test runs. See: [Execute Test Runs manually in TestOps](/execute/schedule-test-execution/execute-test-runs-manually-in-testops).

-   Integrate to the CI/CD pipeline of your choice with KDI to execute tests with code changes. See: [CI/CD Integration Overview](/execute/ci-cd-integrations/ci-cd-integration-overview).
