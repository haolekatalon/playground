# View BDD test results in TestOps

Behavior-driven development \(BDD\) is enabled in Katalon Studio. From Katalon Studio version 7.8.0, you can integrate BDD-enabled projects with Katalon TestOps. By doing so, you can see native BDD Test Results with their Features and Scenarios.

## Requirements

-   You have a BDD Project in Katalon Studio. See: [BDD Testing Framework \(Cucumber integration\)](/integrations/supported-integrations/integrate-katalon-studio-with-other-katalon-platform-tools#).

-   You have enabled Katalon TestOps integration in Katalon Studio. See: [Upload Test Results to Katalon TestOps from Katalon Studio](/analyze/reports/upload-test-reports/upload-test-results-from-katalon-studio-to-katalon-testops-manually).


## Upload and view BDD Test Results in Katalon TestOps

### Configure BDD Settings

You can configure BDD Settings in Katalon TestOps to upload BDD Test Results automatically. Follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your Project.

2.  Click on the *Settings* icon at the top right corner, and choose **Project Settings**.

4.  Click **Save**.


### View BDD Test Results

Once you have configured BDD Settings, Katalon TestOps recognizes and processes BDD-based Test Results.

To view BDD Test Results, go to your **Project** &gt; **Planning** &gt; **Requirements**.

The **Requirements** page appears as below.

In the **Requirements** section, you can see the Features of your BDD Tests displayed in the **Name** column \(the green icon next to each Name is a *Feature* icon\).

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/bdd-test-results-in-TestOps/image/ks-login-feature.png" width={850} />

If you click on one of the Features \(e.g., Login Feature\), you can see the Scenario of your BDD Test \(the blue icon is a *Scenario* icon\).

<img src="/doc_images/Documents/Analyze/Reports/View_Test_Reports/View_reports_in_TestOps/bdd-test-results-in-TestOps/image/ks-result-by-requirements.png" width={850} />

The Scenarios also appear on the **Test Runs** page \(go to **Reports** &gt; **Test Runs**\).

### View BDD Test Results in Traceability Matrix

Go to **Reports** &gt; **Requirements**, then select the **Traceability Matrix** tab.

You can view BDD Test Results and manage the relationships across BDD Features \(displayed in the **Requirements** column\), BDD Scenarios \(displayed in the **Test Cases** column\), and Defects.
