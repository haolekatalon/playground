# Katalon Studio - pCloudy integration


:::note

-   Please note that the use case presented here is a suggestion only and should be implemented with caution. It has not undergone quality assurance testing and is not officially supported by our platform.


:::

Katalon Studio enables you to perform automated Mobile and Web Testing by creating codeless automation scripts with a powerful record and playback feature. Integrating Katalon Studio with pCloudy will help you run your existing scripts on 5000+ browser and device combinations.

## Running Katalon Tests on pCloudy Device Cloud

-   User must have a registered pCloudy account.
-   Mobile Application must be uploaded to the [My Data](https://www.pcloudy.com/docs/uploading-an-android-app) section on pCloudy portal.
-   Katalon Studio

1.  You can open an existing project on Katalon Studio. In this example we are using a sample test case using Mobile keywords, where we Launch an Android application, then click at two elements and close the application.

    You will need to provide the application name for the **Input** of **Start Application** Keyword.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS-_input_keyword.png" alt="input keyword in Katalon Studio" />

2.  To generate the capabilities, the user can use the [Capability Configurator](https://device.pcloudy.com/user?tab=capabilities) from the pCloudy platform as shown below.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/pCloudy-_capability_configurator.png" alt="pCloudy capability configurator" />

    
    :::note

    -   The URL for the device cloud is included with the capabilities.

    -   Make sure the selected device is available on the device cloud before running the script.

    -   You can also get the API key from the [profile section](https://device.pcloudy.com/settings?tab=profile) on the pCloudy platform as mentioned below. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/pCloudy_API_key_.png" />

    :::

3.  To add the capabilities on Katalon remote server, navigate to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Desired Capabilities** &gt; **Remote**.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS-_remote_server.png" alt="Katalon Studio remote server" />

4.  Now choose **Remote** from the **Run** options.<img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS-_remote_run.png" alt="Katalon Studio remote run" />

5.  Now the mentioned device from the capabilities will be acquired on the pCloudy platfrom and the scripts will be executed. You will be able to view the live session under **My Active Sessions** on the pCloudy platform. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/pcloudy_-_My_active_sessions.png" alt="pCloudy - my Active Sessions" />


## Using Katalon Studioâ€™s Record Mobile Feature on pCloudy Devices

1.  Choose **Remote Devices** from the **Record Mobile**. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_Remote_devices.png" alt="Katalon Studio remote devices" />

2.  Provide the Application name for the **Cloud Application ID** and click on **Start**. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_Cloud_Application_ID.png" alt="Katalon Studio Cloud Application ID" />

3.  Now you can record the steps on the application via pCloudy device and create the steps for the test and all the objects will be stored inside **Object Repository** on Katalon.

    Here we are choosing the **Accept** icon from the application and performing a **Tap** action on it. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_record_test_steps_pCloudy.png" alt="Katalon Studio record test step" />The recorded objects will be stored into **Object Repository** as shown below in Katalon Studio. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_object_repository.png" alt="Katalon Studio object repository" />


## Running Katalon Tests on pCloudy Browser Cloud

1.  Open an existing project on Katalon which you want to Execute. In this example we are using a sample test case with **Web UI Keywords**, where we open a browser and navigate to an URL and close the browser. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_sample_WebUI_test_case_.png" alt="Katalon Studio - Web UI test case" />

2.  To add the capabilities for Browser Cloud on Katalon remote server, navigate to **Project** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Desired Capabilities** &gt; **Remote**.

    For our example, connect to a Chrome browser on Windows OS with the capabilities in the screenshot below: <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/Ks_-_remote_server_deisred_capabilities.png" alt="Katalon Studio remote server capabilities" />For **apiKey** capabilitiy, you can get the Browser Cloud URL and API Key from the [profile section](https://device.pcloudy.com/settings?tab=profile) on the pCloudy platform.

    
    :::note

    -   The URL for the browser cloud is <code>https://prod-browsercloud-in.pcloudy.com/seleniumcloud/wd/hub</code>.
    -   Make sure the selected device is available on browser cloud before running.

3.  Next, choose **Remote** from the **Run** options. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_remote_web_run.png" alt="Katalon Studio remote run" />

4.  Now the mentioned device from the capabilities will be acquired on the pCloudy platform and the scripts will be executed. You will be able to view the live session under **My Active Sessions** on the pCloudy platform. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/pcloudy_-_web_test-__My_active_sessions.png" alt="pCloudy - My active sessions" />


## Running parallel tests using Katalon on pCloudy Browser Cloud

1.  Create two Test Cases \(Example: **Testcase1** and **Testcase2**\) in Katalon Studio. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_parallel_test_cases.png" alt="Katalon Studio create a test case 1" /><img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_create_testcase_2.png" alt="Katalon Studio test case 2" />

2.  Create two different Test Suites \(Example: **Test Suite 1** and **Test Suite 2**\) and add the Test Cases to each Test Suites as illustrated below. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_create_test_case_2.png" alt="create test suite 1" /><img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_create_test_suite_2.png" alt="create test suite 2" />

3.  Next, create a **Test Suite Collection** \(Example: **pCloudy Testsuite Collection**\) and add the Test Suite 1 and 2 to the Test Suite Collection. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/Ks_-_create_test_suite_collection.png" alt="create test suite collection" />

4.  Next, open **Execution** from **Project Settings** and select **Remote** from **Default execution** and check the **Post Execution Options** as mentioned below. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-__project_settings_-_Exection.png" alt="Katalon Studio - project settings - execution" />

5.  Next, select the **Run Environment** to **Remote**. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_remote_run_environment.png" alt="Katalon Studio - remote run environment" />

6.  Select **Parallel** from the **Execution Mode** and click **Execute**. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_parallel_execution_mode.png" alt="Katalon Studio - parallel exectution" /><img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/KS_-_execute.png" alt="Katalon Studio execution" />

7.  Now the mentioned browser from the capabilities will be acquired on the pCloudy platform and the scripts will be executed. You will be able to view the live session under **My Active Sessions** on the pCloudy platform. <img src="/doc_images/Documents/General_Information/Unsupported-Integrations/pCloudy/images/pCloudy_-_parallel_testing-_My_active_sessions.png" alt="pCloudy- my active sessions" />
