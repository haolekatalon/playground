# Brand guidelines for Katalon Store publishers

### Logo

Use a unique logo to represent your brand and unique logos to represent your plugins in the Katalon Store.

***Note 4: Do not use Katalon-owned illustrations, icons, or other brand assets.***

## Plugin name in Katalon Store

-   All of plugin names are written in **title case**. That means **each letter** except the first letter in the name is **lowercase**. All references to our products in text must utilize the proper case.

    Example:

    DYNAMIC FILTERING TEST SUITE ⇒ Dynamic Filtering Test Suite

    Dynamic filtering test suite ⇒ Dynamic Filtering Test Suite

-   Use names that describe what your plugin does or that match your brand.

-   Don't use names that seem to indicate the plugin is built by Katalon. Your plugin name should never start with a Katalon product name \(Katalon Studio\). Instead, use the following pattern: **\[Your plugin\]** for **\[Katalon Studio\]**.

    **Examples of approved names:**

    Dynamic Filtering Test Suite for Katalon Studio

    Themes for Katalon Studio

    **Examples of NOT approved names:**

    Katalon Studio Bug Fixer

    Katalon Studio Themes
