# Integrate Jenkins on Docker hosted in Ubuntu


:::note

-   An active floating Katalon Runtime Engine license.
-   Docker and Jenkins already installed and configured. You can learn how to install Docker and Jenkins in this Jenkins guide: [Docker](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/).

:::

Docker is a platform for running applications in an isolated environment called a Docker container. Applications like Jenkins can be downloaded as read-only images, each of which is run in Docker as a container.

However, when your Jenkins is installed on a dynamic Docker hosted in Ubuntu without GUI, you might not be able to configure build and integration with Katalon Studio from the user interface normally.

This tutorial will guide you through configuring and building your Katalon Project with Jenkins on Docker hosted in Ubuntu. Your Katalon Project will be run with Katalon Studio Docker Image; hence pre-installed Katalon Studio and Katalon Runtime Engine in your local machine are not required. You can pull Docker Image for Katalon Studio at Docker Hub: [katalonstudio/katalon](https://hub.docker.com/r/katalonstudio/katalon).

## Integrate with Docker on Jenkins

To integrate with Docker on Jenkins, you need to install the **Docker Plugins** and **Docker Pipeline**, then set an environment path to Jenkins. Do as follows:

### Install plugins

1.  Open Jenkins, then go to **Dashboard &gt; Manage Jenkins &gt; Manage Plugins**.

2.  The Plugin Manager page appears. In the **Available** tab, search for **Docker Plugin** and **Docker Pipeline**, then select them.

3.  Click **Install without restart**.


### Add an Environment Path

To run Docker commands from Jenkins, you need to add an environment path to Jenkins. The <code>PATH</code> specifies where to find the folder containing Docker commands.

Go to **Dashboard &gt; Manage Jenkins &gt; Configure System &gt; Global properties**. Select the **Environment variables** to add a global variable named <code>PATH</code> with this value: <code>$PATH:/usr/local/bin:</code>.

## Upload your Katalon project on Jenkins


:::note

-   Make sure you have Docker open, with **Docker Plugin** and **Docker Pipeline** activated on Jenkins.
-   You can clone or download our sample CI/CD project at our GitHub repository: [CI sample](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/ci-samples).

:::

You can either upload your Katalon project from a Git repository or your local workspace.

### Upload a Git repository

1.  Prepare your Katalon project repository on GitHub.
2.  In the Jenkins Dashboard, go to **New Item** and create a **Freestyle project**.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jenkins-docker/new-item.png" alt="new item" />

3.  In the **Source Code Management** section, choose **Git**.

4.  Enter your repository URL, select branches to build, repository browser, and additional behaviours, if any.

### Upload in the local workspace

1.  Put your CI/CD project folder in this directory: <code>Users/Your&#95;user&#95;name/.jenkins/workspace</code>. Copy your project folder name.
2.  In the Jenkins Dashboard, go to **New Item** and create a **Freestyle project**. Name your project the same name as your project folder in your local Jenkins workspace.

## Build your project

1.  In the **Build** section, click **Add build step** and choose **Execute shell**. Input your command, for example:

    ```
    docker run -t --rm -v "$(pwd)":/tmp/project katalonstudio/katalon katalonc.sh -projectPath=/tmp/project -browserType="Chrome" -retry=0 -statusDelay=15 -testSuitePath="Test Suites/TS_RegressionTest" -apikey=<YOUR_API_KEY>
    
    ```

    :::note

    You can find more command line options at [Command Syntax](/execute/katalon-runtime-engine/command-line-syntax-in-katalon-runtime-engine#).

    :::

    After you are done with the configuration, click **Save**.

2.  In your project, click **Build Now**.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jenkins-docker/build-now.png" width={500} alt="build now" />

3.  To view the console log, click on your current build on Jenkins and select **Console Output**.

    In the **Console Output**, you can view the status when Docker starts finding the image <code>katalonstudio/katalon</code>, verifying your licenses, reloading plugins, then executing your test. If Docker cannot find the <code>katalonstudio/katalon</code> image locally, it automatically pulls this image.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jenkins-docker/console-output.png" alt="console output" />

    When the test is being run, you can also view this console log in Docker.

4.  To view your report files, you can go to this directory: <code>Users/Your&#95;user&#95;name/.jenkins/workspace/Your&#95;project&#95;name/Reports</code> or your third-party integration like Katalon TestOps, Azure DevOps, or qTest.

    
    :::note

    -   For real-time monitoring and better reporting capabilities, consider integrating your project with Katalon TestOps.
